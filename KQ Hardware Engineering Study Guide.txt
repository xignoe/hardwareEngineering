1. What is ohm law?
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. The mathematical representation is V = IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance.
________________


2. Conceptually explain ohm's law.
Ohm's law can be conceptually understood as a water pipe. Here, the voltage is akin to the water pressure, current is analogous to the flow rate, and resistance is similar to the pipe size. More water pressure (voltage) results in a higher flow rate (current), unless the pipe is made smaller (increases resistance).

3. What are some basic circuit analysis laws?
   1. Ohm’s law, which relates current (I) and voltage (V) using resistance (R), where R is a constant: V = IR or I = V/R or R = V/I.
   2. Kirchhoff’s current law: Sum of incoming currents = sum of outgoing currents at a node
   3. Kirchhoff’s voltage law: Sum of voltage rises = sum of voltage drops around a closed loop
________________


4. What are KCL/KVL?
   1. Kirchhoff’s current law: Sum of incoming currents = sum of outgoing currents at a node
   2. Kirchhoff’s voltage law: Sum of voltage rises = sum of voltage drops around a closed loop


________________


5. Basic KCL/KVL circuit problems.
Here are a few examples of basic circuit problems that can be solved using Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), along with their solutions:
KCL Problem:
A circuit has three resistors (R1 = 2 ohms, R2 = 3 ohms, R3 = 4 ohms) connected in series, and a current source of 6 amps. The current flowing through R1 is to be determined.
   3. Applying KCL at the node where the resistors are connected, we have:
I1 + I2 + I3 = 6 amps (where I1, I2, and I3 are the currents flowing through R1, R2, and R3 respectively)
   4. Since the resistors are in series, the current flowing through them is the same, so 
I1 = I2 = I3.
   5. Therefore, we can write:
I1 + I1 + I1 = 6 amps
3I1 = 6 amps 
I1 = 2 amps


KVL Problem:
A circuit has a voltage source of 12 volts, a resistor of 8 ohms and a resistor of 4 ohms connected in parallel. The voltage across R1 is to be determined.
   6. Applying KVL around the loop, we have:
V1 + V2 = 12 volts (where V1 and V2 are the voltages across R1 and R2 respectively)
   7. Since the resistors are in parallel, the voltage across them is the same, so 
V1 = V2 = V.
   8. Therefore, we can write:
V + V = 12 volts
2V = 12 volts
2V = 6 volts
It's worth noting that these are basic examples, more complex circuits might have multiple loops and multiple nodes where the KCL and KVL have to be applied. Additionally, you might have to use other circuit analysis laws such as Ohm's law and the others I mentioned earlier to solve more complex problems.

6. What is the equation to find power?
   1. Power (P) is exactly equal to current (I) multiplied by voltage (V)
   2. VI
   3. I2R
   4. V2/R
________________


7. Why is power loss often due to current, not voltage?


Power loss in electric circuits often occurs due to the heat generated by the resistance to the current flow, as given by the formula P = I2R. This power loss (also known as Joule heating) increases with the square of the current, implying that higher currents will lead to higher power losses.

8. Draw a voltage divider circuit. What is the voltage divider equation? Derive it.
A voltage divider is a simple circuit which turns a large voltage into a smaller one. It consists of two resistors in series connected to an input voltage. The output voltage is a fraction of the input voltage and is determined by the ratio of the two resistors. The voltage divider equation is Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2)).
  

________________


9. Basic RLC circuit analysis.
   1. An RLC circuit consists of a resistor (R), inductor (L), and capacitor (C). Analysis of these circuits involves understanding the effects of impedance and resonance, which are frequency-dependent properties.


________________


10. Basic LPF/BPF/HPF filter analysis.
   1. Low-pass filters (LPF) allow signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass and attenuates frequencies above the cutoff. High-pass filters (HPF) do the opposite, and band-pass filters (BPF) only allow frequencies within a certain range to pass.


________________


11. Passive components' parasitics.
   1. A parasitic element is a circuit element (resistance, inductance or capacitance) that is possessed by an electrical component but which it is not desirable for it to have for its intended purpose. For instance, a resistor is designed to possess resistance, but will also possess unwanted parasitic capacitance.
________________


12. Basic opamp circuit analysis.
   1. Operational amplifiers (op-amps) are fundamental building blocks in analog electronics. They are used to amplify or process signals. The two main configurations are the inverting and non-inverting amplifier circuits, which differ in whether the input is applied to the inverting (-) or non-inverting (+) terminal of the op-amp. The analysis of these circuits often involves the use of the golden rules of op-amp analysis.

13. Draw the symbol for a resistor.
  

________________


14. What is resistance?
   1. The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current.
________________


15. What does resistance depend on?
   1. The resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of. Objects made of electrical insulators like rubber tend to have very high resistance and low conductance, while objects made of electrical conductors like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductance.
________________


16. Draw a realistic circuit model for a resistor. What are parasitics and where do they come from?
  

Parasitics in electronics refer to unintended, often unwanted, passive elements that arise from the physical construction of components and circuits. They typically include parasitic capacitance, inductance, and resistance. These elements originate from various sources: the inherent properties of conductors and insulators (like stray capacitance between wiring or layers on a PCB), the physical layout of the circuit (such as inductance in long traces or loops), and the non-ideal behavior of components (like the intrinsic capacitance and inductance in transistors or resistors). Parasitics can significantly affect the performance of high-frequency and precision circuits, leading to issues like signal distortion, noise, undesired resonances, or heat generation, and thus they must be carefully considered and minimized in circuit design.

20. What are pullup/pulldown resistors? How do you spec them?
In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor (PU) or pull-down resistor (PD) is a resistor used to ensure a known state for a signal. A pull-up resistor connects the pin to a high voltage (typically VCC) to set it to a default high state, while a pull-down connects it to ground to set a default low state. Specifying these resistors involves considering the input leakage current and voltage of the device, the resistor's power dissipation, and the need to balance against other factors like power consumption and signal rise time. Typically, values range from 1 kΩ to 100 kΩ; higher values consume less power but make the line more susceptible to noise and slower to respond, while lower values provide faster response times but consume more power. The exact value is chosen based on the specific requirements of the circuit and the device it is interfacing with.

Capacitors
21. Draw the symbol for a capacitor.


________________


22. What is capacitance?
Capacitance is the capability of a material object or device to store electric charge. It is measured by the change in charge in response to a difference in electric potential, expressed as the ratio of those quantities.
________________


23. What is a dielectric?
A dielectric is a material that is a poor conductor of electricity but an efficient supporter of electrostatic fields. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, it does not conduct electricity, but it allows the field to pass through it more effectively than through a vacuum or air. This is due to the alignment of its internal electric dipoles within the field, which reduces the field's overall strength and allows the storage of electrical energy. This property makes dielectrics crucial in capacitors, where they are used to increase the capacitance without increasing the physical size of the component. Dielectrics can be solids, liquids, or gasses. Common examples include materials like glass, porcelain, plastic, and various oils, each chosen for specific electrical and physical properties such as dielectric strength (ability to withstand high electric fields without breakdown), permittivity (ability to permit electrostatic field lines), and thermal stability.
________________


24. What is the equation for impedance of a capacitor?
   1. xC = 1/ωC = 1/2πƒC
      1. C is capacitance value in farads
      2. xC is the capacitor’s reactance in ohms 
      3. ω is the angular frequency in rad/s
      4. ƒ is the frequency in hertz
   2.  Z = -jX
   3. A capacitor's impedance decreases with increasing frequency and capacitance. At very high frequencies, a capacitor behaves almost like a short circuit, while at very low frequencies, it behaves like an open circuit. This property is crucial in applications like filtering, where capacitors block low-frequency signals and allow high-frequency signals to pass.
________________


25. What is the differential equation for a capacitor?
  
________________

26. Does a capacitor have positive or negative reactance?
The reactance of an ideal capacitor, and therefore its impedance, is negative for all frequency and capacitance values. Reactance is a measure of how a capacitor or inductor opposes the flow of current.
________________
27. What is the continuity condition? What do inductors resist change to?
Continuity is the presence of a complete path for current flow. A closed switch that is operational, for example, has continuity. 
________________


28. How does a capacitor behave when initially excited and at DC steady-state?
Capacitors become open circuits, which means that there is a break in the circuit, in D.C. steady state, while inductors become short circuits, which means they become a wire, in D.C. steady state.
________________


29. What is an inductors impedance at DC vs infinitely high frequency? Plot this behavior.  
For a capacitor the impedance is infinite at D.C. and approaches zero as the frequency approached infinity, whereas for an inductor the impedance is zero for D.C. and approaches infinity at an infinite frequency. Note: The impedance only gives us a value for the magnitude.
________________


   30. Draw a realistic circuit model for a capacitor. What are the parasitics and where do they come from?
  

In a realistic circuit model, a capacitor not only has its intended capacitance but also includes parasitic elements due to its physical construction and materials used. The primary parasitics are Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and Equivalent Series Inductance (ESL). ESR arises from the resistance of the capacitor's plates and the dielectric losses, contributing to power dissipation and affecting the capacitor's performance at high frequencies. ESL is caused by the physical coils of the leads and the capacitor's internal structure, which act as small inductors, limiting the capacitor's ability to respond to rapid changes in voltage, especially at high frequencies. Additionally, there may be stray capacitances due to the physical layout, which can couple the capacitor with other parts of the circuit, leading to unintended interactions. These parasitic elements are crucial considerations in high-frequency and precision applications, as they can significantly impact the behavior and effectiveness of the capacitor in a circuit.
________________


   31. What is a capacitor's self resonant frequency?
Self-resonance frequency The frequency at which resonance occurs due to the capacitor's own capacitance, and residual inductance. It is the frequency at which the impedance of the capacitor becomes zero.
________________


   32. What is a bypass/decoupling capacitor? What about a bulk capacitor? What is the difference?
A bypass or decoupling capacitor is used in electronic circuits to bypass AC noise from a power supply or other sources, grounding it and thereby decoupling it from the signal or other components in the circuit. These capacitors are typically placed close to an IC or power-consuming component and are usually in the range of nanofarads to microfarads. A bulk capacitor, on the other hand, is used to store and supply a larger amount of energy to a circuit, especially to smooth out fluctuations in power supply and to provide power during transient events. They are generally of a higher capacitance (often in the range of microfarads to farads) and are placed at the power supply entrance of a circuit board. The key difference lies in their function and capacitance values: bypass capacitors handle high-frequency noise and are smaller in value, while bulk capacitors deal with power supply stability and are larger.
________________




   33. What is an AC coupling capacitor?


An AC coupling capacitor is used in electronic circuits to transmit AC signals while blocking DC components. It's placed in series with the signal path, allowing only the AC part of a signal to pass through. This is crucial in applications like audio processing and radio frequency circuits, where it's important to isolate AC signals from DC biasing conditions. The value of the capacitor is selected based on the lowest frequency of the AC signal to ensure effective transmission.
________________


   34. What sort of signals can capacitors pass through and block? What sort of filter behavior is this?
Being that capacitors offer very high resistance to low frequency signals and low resistance to high frequency signals, it acts as a high pass filter, which is a filter which passes high frequency signals and blocks low frequency signals.

________________


   36. What are some common failure modes of a capacitor?
When an electrolytic capacitor fails, it can be because of a short circuit, circuit damage, or even an explosion. Common failure modes of capacitors include electrical leakage, dielectric breakdown, and physical damage. Electrical leakage, often caused by deterioration of the dielectric material, leads to a gradual loss of capacitance and increased power consumption. Dielectric breakdown, which may occur due to overvoltage or aging, results in a short circuit within the capacitor. Physical damage, such as bulging or cracking of the capacitor body, is typically due to overheating or mechanical stress and can lead to catastrophic failure. In electrolytic capacitors, drying out of the electrolyte is another common failure mode, leading to reduced capacitance and increased equivalent series resistance (ESR). These failures can be influenced by factors like excessive voltage, high temperature, mechanical stress, and poor quality control during manufacturing. Most electrolytic capacitor degradation results from a common failure mode: the vaporization or leakage of electrolyte.
________________




   37. What is the continuity condition? What do capacitors resist change to?
The continuity condition in electrical circuits refers to the principle that the current through a capacitor cannot change instantaneously. This is because capacitors resist sudden changes in voltage across their terminals. When a voltage is applied to a capacitor, it stores energy in the form of an electric field, and this process takes time, preventing an immediate change in voltage. This characteristic makes capacitors useful for smoothing out fluctuations in power supply and for filtering out rapid changes in a signal, as they allow gradual changes in voltage while opposing rapid spikes or drops. This behavior is fundamental in various applications, from power supply stabilization to signal processing in electronic circuits.

Inductors
   38. Draw the symbol for an inductor.
  

________________


   39. What is inductance?
Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it. 
________________


   40. What is the equation for impedance of an inductor?
The formula of the impedance of inductor is: Z = jLw , where: Z: is the impedance in ohms. j: is the operator for imaginary numbers


________________


   41. What is the differential equation for an inductor?
        Growing current  


Decaying current
  

The differential equation for an inductor in a circuit is derived from the basic property of an inductor, which states that the voltage across an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of current through it. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
Voltage (V) = Inductance (L) x Rate of change of current (di/dt)


This equation essentially captures the behavior of an inductor in response to changing currents, highlighting its property of opposing changes in current flow. In an inductive circuit, any change in current generates a voltage across the inductor that opposes this change, a phenomenon known as self-inductance.


________________


   42. Does an inductor have positive or negative reactance?
The reactance of an ideal inductor, and therefore its impedance, is positive for all frequency and inductance values.
________________


   43. What is the continuity condition? What do inductors resist change to?
   1. The continuity condition in mathematics and physics refers to a property where a function or signal remains unbroken and consistent across its domain. In simpler terms, it means that if you were to draw the graph of the function, you could do so without lifting your pen off the paper.
   2. Inductors primarily resist changes in electric current. They work on the principle of electromagnetism, where a change in current creates a magnetic field, and this field, in turn, opposes further changes in current. This resistance to change is a fundamental characteristic of inductors, often described as "inductive reactance."
________________


   44. How does an inductor behave when initially excited and at DC steady-state?
When an inductor is initially excited by a direct current (DC), it temporarily opposes the change, creating a magnetic field. Once the current stabilizes, the inductor's resistance to change drops significantly, and it behaves much like a short circuit, offering minimal resistance to the steady DC flow.
________________


   45. What is an inductor's impedance at DC vs infinitely high frequency? Plot this behavior.
At direct current (DC), an inductor's impedance is effectively zero, meaning it allows DC to pass through with minimal resistance. At infinitely high frequencies, the impedance of an inductor skyrockets, making it a formidable barrier to alternating current (AC). This behavior is opposite to that of a capacitor.
________________


   46. What happens when an inductor saturates?
When the inductor enters saturation, it can store less energy and the ripple current increases – meaning that the efficiency will be reduced. At this point, the inductor is behaving more like a resistor than an inductor.
________________


   47. Draw a realistic circuit model for an inductor. What are the parasitics and where do they come from?
A realistic circuit model of an inductor includes its ideal inductance plus parasitic elements such as series resistance (representing wire resistance) and parallel capacitance (due to the electric field between the turns of the coil). These parasitics affect the inductor's performance, especially at high frequencies.  
________________


   48. What do cores do on inductors?
Cores in inductors serve two main purposes: they provide mechanical support for the coil windings and, more importantly, enhance the magnetic field created by the current flowing through the inductor. This enhancement allows for more efficient energy storage and transfer within the inductor.
________________
   49. What are typical core materials?
Common core materials for inductors include ferromagnetic substances like iron and ferrite, which enhance the inductor's magnetic properties. These materials are chosen for their ability to concentrate magnetic flux and for their magnetic permeability.
________________


   50. What are the main loss mechanisms of an inductor? Where do they arise from?
Power is lost in an inductor through several different mechanisms: Resistance of the windings - 'copper loss'. Magnetic friction in the core - 'hysteresis'. Electric currents induced in the core - 'eddy currents'
________________


   51. What is ACR? Where does it arise from and how is it impacted by frequency?
ACR stands for Automatic Circuit Recloser, a type of electrical protection device designed to automatically reset or "reclose" an electrical circuit after a fault or interruption, thereby restoring power without manual intervention. It helps maintain service continuity in power distribution networks.
________________


   52. What sort of signals can inductors pass through and block? What sort of filter behavior is this?
Inductors pass low-frequency signals with very little resistance, while offering great resistance to signals of high frequency. Thus, low-frequency signals pass through very easily without any attenuation and high frequency signals are either completely blocked or greatly attenuated as output. This is LPF low-pass filter behavior.
________________


   53. Build a LPF/HPF using a single inductor.
To build a low-pass filter (LPF), you can connect an inductor in series with the load. For a high-pass filter (HPF), connect an inductor in parallel with the load. The inductor's impedance at different frequencies determines the filtering effect.


________________


   54. What are some common failure modes of an inductor?
Inductors often fail open due to corrosion or bad internal solder joints or the inductors fail shorted due to electrical overstress, bad magnet wire insulation, or potting issues.

   55. What is a conductor/insulator/semiconductor?
A conductor is a material that allows the flow of charge when applied with a voltage. A semiconductor is a material whose conductivity lies between conductor & insulator. An insulator is a material that does not allow the flow of current.
________________
   56. What is the skin effect?
Skin effect is the tendency of an alternating electric current (AC) to become distributed within a conductor such that the current density is largest near the surface of the conductor and decreases exponentially with greater depths in the conductor. The electric current flows mainly at the "skin" of the conductor, between the outer surface and a level called the skin depth.
________________
   57. What is the photoelectric effect?
The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, hits a material. Electrons emitted in this manner are called photoelectrons. The phenomenon is studied in condensed matter physics, and solid state and quantum chemistry to draw inferences about the properties of atoms, molecules and solids. The effect has found use in electronic devices specialized for light detection and precisely timed electron emission.
________________


   58. Explain any dielectric losses and how they occur.
Dielectric losses depend on frequency and the dielectric material. Heating through dielectric loss is widely employed industrially for heating thermosetting glues, for drying lumber and other fibrous materials, for preheating plastics before molding, and for fast jelling and drying of foam rubber.
________________
   59. How does electricity work?
Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the existence and motion of charged particles, such as electrons and protons. In conductive materials, electricity manifests as the movement of electrons through a conductor (like a wire) when a potential difference (voltage) is applied across it. This flow of electrons can be harnessed to perform work, such as lighting a bulb, powering a motor, or heating a home. The fundamentals of electricity are rooted in the principles of electromagnetism, which describe how electric charges interact with each other and with magnetic fields.
________________


   60. How does lightning work?
Lightning is a dramatic natural electrical discharge caused by the buildup of static electricity in storm clouds. This buildup occurs through the friction between ice crystals, water droplets, and other particles within a cloud, leading to a separation of positive and negative charges. The cloud becomes positively charged at its top and negatively charged at its base. When the electric field strength exceeds the air's capacity to insulate these charges, a rapid discharge of electricity occurs, either within the cloud, between clouds, or between the cloud and the ground, creating lightning. This discharge can heat the air to temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, leading to the characteristic flash and thunder.
________________


   61. Which atom bands do electrons move in?
The conduction band is the band of electron orbitals that electrons can jump up into from the valence band when excited. When the electrons are in these orbitals, they have enough energy to move freely in the material. This movement of electrons creates an electric current.

   62. What is the difference between P-type semiconductors vs N-type semiconductors?
In a p-type semiconductor, the majority carriers are holes (absence of electrons), and the minority carriers are electrons. But In the n-type semiconductor, electrons are the majority carriers, and holes the minority carriers.
________________
   63. What is a depletion region and how does it form?
Depletion regions form at the junction of a p-n semiconductor. Filling a hole makes a negative ion and leaves behind a positive ion on the n-side. A space charge builds up, creating a depletion region which inhibits any further electron transfer unless it is helped by putting a forward bias on the junction.
________________
   64. What materials are typically used for semiconductors?
What are the most used semiconductor materials? The most used semiconductor materials are silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide. Of the three, germanium was one of the earliest semiconductor materials used. Gallium arsenide is used for high speed devices requiring a broader spectrum of light absorption. Silicon is the most widely used and understood. 
________________
   65. What is doping?
Doping is the intentional introduction of impurities into an intrinsic (pure) semiconductor to modify its electrical properties. The process involves adding a small amount of trivalent (for p-type) or pentavalent (for n-type) elements to the semiconductor material. This alters the balance of electrons and holes, enhancing the material's conductivity and enabling the creation of electronic devices like diodes and transistors.
________________


   66. How does doping improve performance?
Doping significantly enhances a semiconductor's electrical conductivity and enables control over its electrical properties. By introducing dopants in controlled amounts, semiconductors can be tailored to serve as either p-type or n-type materials, facilitating the creation of p-n junctions essential for electronic devices. High levels of doping can produce degenerate semiconductors, which behave more like conductors, allowing for the design of devices with very specific electrical characteristics.
________________


   67. What elements are typically used for doping?
For doping silicon, the most commonly used elements are boron (for p-type doping) and arsenic or phosphorus (for n-type doping). Gallium is also occasionally used. Boron is preferred for p-type doping in silicon integrated circuits because its diffusion properties allow for precise control over junction depths.
________________
   68. What is charge mobility?
Charge mobility measures how quickly electrons or holes can move through a semiconductor or metal when subjected to an electric field. In solid-state physics, electron mobility characterizes how quickly an electron can move through a metal or semiconductor when pulled by an electric field. There is an analogous quantity for holes, called hole mobility. The term carrier mobility refers in general to both electron and hole mobility.
________________
   69. What charge carriers are dominant in P-type semiconductors vs N-type semiconductors?
In a p-type semiconductor, the majority carriers are holes, and the minority carriers are electrons. But In the n-type semiconductor, electrons are the majority carriers, and holes the minority carriers
________________
   70. Which charge carriers are more mobile: holes or electrons?
The mobility of free electrons is greater than that of holes because they carry negative charge. The physical properties of electrons allow them to move more efficiently through the crystal lattice.
________________
   71. Why do N-type semiconductors typically have lower resistance?
An n-type semiconductor has higher conductivity because there are more electrons.

Diodes
________________




   72. How does a diode work?
A diode is a semiconductor device that essentially acts as a one-way switch for current. It allows current to flow easily in one direction, but severely restricts current from flowing in the opposite direction.
________________


   73. What are some use cases of a diode?
Diodes serve various roles in electronics, including rectification (converting AC to DC), signal clipping (limiting the voltage to a device), voltage regulation (maintaining a constant voltage level), and serving as protection devices against voltage spikes. Additionally, specialized diodes like LEDs and Zener diodes are used for illumination and voltage regulation, respectively.
________________


   74. Draw IV curve.
A current–voltage characteristic or  I–V curve (current–voltage curve) is a relationship, typically represented as a chart or graph, between the electric current through a circuit, device, or material, and the corresponding voltage, or potential difference across it.
________________
     75. What are the different operation regions?
Diodes have three main operation regions:
   * Forward Bias: Allows current flow once the applied voltage exceeds the diode's threshold, typically around 0.6-0.7V for silicon diodes.
   * Reverse Bias: Blocks current flow, allowing only minimal leakage, until the breakdown voltage is reached.
   * Breakdown: Conducts current in reverse if the applied voltage exceeds the diode's breakdown voltage, which can damage standard diodes but is normal for Zener diodes used in voltage regulation.
________________


   76. Given a forward/reverse voltage and threshold voltage, determine what operation region it's in.
A forward threshold voltage is voltage at which the semiconductor would start functioning. A breakdown voltage is one at which the semiconductor would fail or breakdown once it reaches the voltage. The operation region depends on the comparison between the applied voltage and the threshold voltage. In forward bias, if the applied voltage is above the threshold voltage, the device is in the active or saturation region. In reverse bias, if the voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage, it enters the breakdown region.
________________
   77. What are the different kinds of diodes?
   1. Light Emitting Diode (LED): Emits light when forward biased.
   2. Laser Diode: Produces coherent light.
   3. Avalanche Diode: Operates in the avalanche breakdown region for voltage regulation.
   4. Zener Diode: Allows current to flow in reverse direction when a certain reverse voltage is reached, used for voltage regulation.
   5. Schottky Diode: Has a low forward voltage drop and fast switching speed.
   6. Photodiode: Converts light into electrical current.
   7. PN Junction Diode: The basic diode, allowing current to flow in one direction.
________________


   78. What is the typical forward voltage drop across a diode? Why is it this value? How does it differ for different diodes?
The voltage drop across different diodes are different. Typically it ranges from 0.6 to 0.7 volts for a small silicon diode. For schottky diodes, the value of the voltage drop is 0.2 Volt. For light emitting diodes or LEDs, the voltage drop ranges from 1.4-4 Volt.

   79. How can you build an ideal diode?
Creating an "ideal" diode, with zero forward voltage drop and infinite reverse resistance, is theoretically impossible due to physical limitations. However, using circuits with components like BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors) in specific configurations can mimic an ideal diode's characteristics closely for practical purposes.

________________


   81. What are the terminals?
A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has three terminals, called base, collector, and emitter. The BJT exhibits a tremendously useful property: a small current flowing into the base causes a much larger current to flow into the collector.
Base: Controls the transistor's operation.
Collector: The region where the majority of the current flows through.
Emitter: Emits electrons into the base.
________________


   82. What are some use cases of a BJT?
Bipolar junction transistors (Also known as BJTs) can be used as an amplifier, filter, rectifier, oscillator, or even a switch. The transistor will operate as an amplifier or other linear circuit if the transistor is biased into the linear region.
________________
   83. What is the difference between a BJT and MOSFET?
The BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor): Controls current flow using a small input current. It's a current-driven device, sensitive to the base current.

________________


   85. How does it work?
A Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) controls a large current flow between its collector and emitter terminals with a small current at its base terminal. In an NPN transistor, a positive base current allows electrons to flow from the collector to the emitter. In a PNP transistor, a negative base current permits holes to flow from the emitter to the collector. The BJT acts as a current amplifier, useful in amplification and switching applications.
________________


   86. What is the difference between an NPN and PNP?
The primary difference between NPN and PNP transistors lies in their charge carriers and biasing:


   * NPN Transistor: Uses electrons as the majority charge carriers. It requires a positive base current to operate, with current flowing from the collector to the emitter. The emitter is made of N-type material, while the base and collector are P-type.
   * PNP Transistor: Uses holes as the majority charge carriers. It requires a negative base current to operate, with current flowing from the emitter to the collector. The emitter is made of P-type material, while the base and collector are N-type.
   * In both types, a small current at the base controls a larger current between the collector and emitter, but the direction of current flow and the type of charge carriers differ.
________________
   87. What are the different modes of operation?
For a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), there are three main modes of operation:


   * Active Mode: In this mode, the base-emitter junction is forward-biased, and the base-collector junction is reverse-biased. For an NPN transistor, this means applying a positive voltage to the base relative to the emitter and a more positive voltage to the collector. This mode allows the BJT to amplify current.
   * Cutoff Mode: Both the base-emitter and base-collector junctions are reverse-biased. In this mode, the BJT acts like an open switch, and there is no significant current flow through the collector-emitter path.
   * Saturation Mode: Both the base-emitter and base-collector junctions are forward-biased, making the BJT act like a closed switch. In this mode, the transistor allows maximum current to flow from the collector to the emitter.
________________


   *    88. What is current gain/beta?
By definition, current gain β is defined as the ratio of change in collector current to change in base current for a constant collector voltage in a common emitter circuit.

   89. Draw a PFET/NFET symbol.
  

________________


   90. What are the terminals?
Typically, the MOSFET is a three-terminal device with gate (G), drain (D) and source (S) terminals. Current conduction between drain (D) and source (S) is controlled by a voltage applied to the gate (G) terminal.
________________


   91. Which two terminals are often connected together and why?
In certain configurations, the gate and source terminals may be connected together. This is done to ensure that the MOSFET remains in an off state, preventing unintended current flow through the device when no specific control signal is applied.
________________


   92. What are some use cases of a MOSFET?
The MOSFET is the most common type of transistor today. Their primary use is to control conductivity, or how much electricity can flow, between its source and drain terminals based on the amount of voltage applied to its gate terminal. They find applications in power switching, amplifiers, digital circuits, and anywhere precise control over current flow is required.
________________




   93. Why are MOSFETs used so often?
Generally speaking, MOSFETs are cheaper. Over time, we also notice that they become more and more powerful. In addition, for control system integrators there are the added advantages of having a system that is faster to install, configurable most of the time and that requires less wiring.

   94. What is the difference between a BJT and MOSFET?
   1. The BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor): Controls current flow using a small input current. It's a current-driven device, sensitive to the base current.

________________


   96. How does it work?
A MOSFET operates as an electronic switch or amplifier. Applying a voltage to its gate controls current between its drain and source:
   * Off State: No gate voltage blocks current flow.
   * On State: Gate voltage allows current flow, adjustable by voltage magnitude.
   * Voltage-Controlled: Efficient, requires minimal power to operate.
   * Types: N-channel (positive gate voltage) and P-channel (negative gate voltage).
________________


   97. What is the difference between an N-channel and P-channel?
N-Channel MOSFETs use electron flow as the charge carrier. P-Channel MOSFETs use hole flow as the charge carrier, which has less mobility than electron flow. And therefore, they have higher resistance and are less efficient. In other words, a P-Channel MOSFET will get hotter than an N-Channel MOSFET with higher loads.
________________


   98. What is the difference between enhancement-mode and depletion mode?
Enhancement-mode MOSFETs increase channel conductivity by moving the gate voltage toward the drain voltage, while depletion-mode MOSFETs decrease conductivity by moving the gate voltage away from the drain. These modes offer different mechanisms for controlling the device's conductive state.
________________


   99. What are the different modes of operation?
For an enhancement-mode, n-channel MOSFET, the three operational modes are: Cutoff, subthreshold, and weak-inversion mode.
________________


   100. Given Vgs and Vt, how will the FET behave? What operating region will it be in? Load-line analysis.
The behavior of a MOSFET and its operating region depend on Vgs relative to Vt and the drain-to-source voltage (Vds). If Vgs > Vt, the MOSFET can operate in either the cutoff, linear, or saturation region, based on the value of Vds relative to Vgs - Vt.
________________


   101. What is the internal body diode? Where does it come from?
As a consequence of the MOSFET structure, the body diode is formed by the pn junction between the source and drain, and is also called a parasitic diode or an internal diode. The performance of the body diode is one important parameter of the MOSFET, and is important when using the MOSFET in an application


________________


   102. Why are MOSFETs sensitive to overvoltage conditions applied at the gate?
MOSFETs are sensitive to overvoltage conditions due to their high input gate resistance. This sensitivity can lead to device failure if not properly managed, necessitating protective measures in circuit design to prevent damage from excessive voltage or current.
________________


   103. What is W/L ratio? How does it impact FET performance/behavior?
The width-to-length (W/L) ratio is a critical design parameter for MOSFETs that influences the device's current capability, power consumption, and switching speed. Adjusting this ratio allows engineers to optimize the transistor's performance for specific applications.
   * Increasing Width (W) boosts current flow but can raise power consumption and capacitance, affecting switching speed.
   * Increasing Length (L) reduces current flow, enhancing control and reliability but may slow down switching speed.
Key Impacts:
   * Higher W/L ratio: Greater current capability, potentially higher power consumption.
   * Lower W/L ratio: Improved control at lower currents, possibly slower switching.

   104. Given an unnamed circuit, explain how it works and what type of circuit it is. Here are a few of them I've gotten (and know what they're called):
   * Charge pump
   * A charge pump is a kind of DC-to-DC converter that uses capacitors for energetic charge storage to raise or lower voltage. Charge-pump circuits are capable of high efficiencies, sometimes as high as 90–95%, while being electrically simple circuits.
   * Level shifter
   * In digital electronics, a level shifter, also called logic-level shifter or voltage level translator, is a circuit used to translate signals from one logic level or voltage domain to another, allowing compatibility between integrated circuits with different voltage requirements, such as TTL and CMOS
   * LDO
   * A low-dropout regulator is a DC linear voltage regulator that can regulate the output voltage even when the supply voltage is very close to the output voltage
   * RLC filters
   * An RLC circuit is an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C), connected in series or in parallel. The name of the circuit is derived from the letters that are used to denote the constituent components of this circuit, where the sequence of the components may vary from RLC.
   * Current mirror
   * A current mirror is a circuit designed to copy a current through one active device by controlling the current in another active device of a circuit, keeping the output current constant regardless of loading. The current being "copied" can be, and sometimes is, a varying signal current.

CMOS
________________
   105. What is CMOS? Draw a CMOS buffer.
Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor is a type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions.


________________


   106. Why are these so often used?
CMOS offers relatively high speed, low power dissipation, high noise margins in both states, and will operate over a wide range of source and input voltages (provided the source voltage is fixed).
________________
     107. What type of MOSFETs are typically used on the high-side? What about the low-side? Why?
Low-side: N-channel MOSFETs are commonly used for low-side switching due to simpler gate driving requirements. Here, the MOSFET's source is connected to ground, and its drain is connected to the load.
High-side: P-channel MOSFETs are preferred for high-side switching to supply power to devices that are grounded. In this arrangement, the MOSFET's drain is connected to the power supply, and its source is connected to the load.
________________
   108. TTL vs CMOS?
   * TTL uses bipolar junction transistors, while CMOS uses field-effect transistors (FETs).
   * CMOS circuits generally consume significantly less power than TTL circuits but are more susceptible to static discharge.
________________


   109. What is shoot-through on a CMOS logic gate? How can it be prevented?
Shoot-through in CMOS logic gates occurs when both n-type and p-type MOSFETs are conducting simultaneously, leading to direct current from the power supply to ground. This can be minimized by carefully designing the gate control signals to ensure that there is no overlap in the conduction times of the pMOS and nMOS transistors.
________________




   110. CMOS efficiency analysis. How does operational frequency impact efficiency? What about logic/swing levels? Rise/fall times?
   * Operational Frequency: Higher operational frequencies can reduce efficiency due to increased power consumption from charging and discharging parasitic capacitances more frequently.
   * Logic/Swing Levels and Rise/Fall Times: Lower logic levels and faster rise/fall times can increase efficiency by reducing the time and energy required to charge and discharge capacitive loads. However, too rapid switching can lead to greater shoot-through current, reducing efficiency.
________________


   111. How can you achieve faster slew rates?
Typically, the slew rate of an amplifier will increase with increasing temperature. Some amplifiers include a slew boost circuit, which allows for faster slew rates. An example of an amplifier with slew boost is shown in this large signal step response plot.
________________

Electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection design is needed for integrated circuits in CMOS technology. The choice for ESD protection devices in CMOS technology includes diodes, MOSFETs, and silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR).
________________


   113. Draw voltage/current output waveforms for a CMOS buffer connected to a series RC load. Which FETs are conducting during a positive/negative step?
In a CMOS buffer connected to a series RC load, the output voltage waveform would initially spike up or down (depending on the direction of the step) and then settle to the final value following an exponential curve due to the RC time constant. During a positive step, the pMOS conducts initially to charge the load, and during a negative step, the nMOS conducts to discharge the load.
________________
   114. What happens if you swap the high-side PFET and the low-side NFET?
Swapping the high-side pFET with the low-side nFET would disrupt the intended complementary operation of the CMOS circuit, potentially leading to improper functioning, increased power consumption, or even circuit failure due to the loss of the complementary action needed for efficient switching.
________________
Amplifiers
________________


   115. What is common-mode and differential gain? What are their ideal values?
Common-mode gain occurs when identical signals are input to both terminals of an operational amplifier (op-amp), often leading to unwanted noise. The ideal common-mode gain is zero, to minimize noise interference. Differential gain, in contrast, amplifies the difference between the two input signals and ideally should be maximized for effective signal amplification.
________________


   116. What is the gain-bandwidth product?
The gain–bandwidth product (designated as GBWP, GBW, GBP, or GB) for an amplifier is the product of the amplifier's bandwidth and the gain at which the bandwidth is measured.
________________


   117. What determines slew rate and rise/fall time?
The slew rate is determined by the maximum rate of change in the amplifier's output voltage, influenced by the available current to charge or discharge the internal or load capacitance. Rise and fall times, indicating how quickly the output can transition between levels, are similarly affected by the amplifier's design and the load it drives.
________________


   118. Pros/cons of fast/slow slew rates?
Fast slew rates enable quicker response times and higher frequency handling but can lead to overshoot and ringing, potentially distorting the signal. Slow slew rates reduce overshoot and ringing, improving signal stability at the cost of reduced responsiveness and lower bandwidth capabilities. The choice between fast and slow slew rates depends on the specific application requirements, including desired signal fidelity and operational speed.
________________


   119. How to bias an amplifier?
Biasing an amplifier involves setting its operating point through appropriate DC voltages and currents to ensure linear operation over the desired signal range. This typically involves adjusting resistors or applying specific DC voltages at the amplifier inputs or power supply connections.
________________


   120. Why are BJTs more often used for amplifiers than MOSFETs?
BJTs are preferred for amplifiers due to their higher transconductance, allowing for larger current changes with small input voltage variations, which is advantageous for achieving wide bandwidth and linear amplification. Although MOSFETs offer high input impedance and low gate currents, their linearity and bandwidth can be more challenging to optimize for precision amplification tasks.

________________


   122. Draw an opamp. What are the two input terminals?
An operational amplifier diagram typically shows three terminals: two inputs and one output. The inputs are labeled as the inverting input (marked with a minus sign) and the non-inverting input (marked with a plus sign).
________________


   123. What connections are required to wire up an opamp?
Wiring an opamp requires connecting the power supply (positive and negative voltages) to its designated pins, grounding as necessary, and configuring input and feedback connections to its inverting and non-inverting terminals according to the desired operational mode.
________________


   124. What are the three rules of an ideal opamp?

________________


   126. What is the DC gain of an ompamp?
The open-loop dc gain (usually referred to as AVOL) is the gain of the amplifier without the feedback loop being closed, hence the name “open-loop.” For a precision op amp this gain can be very high, on the order of 160 dB (100 million) or more.
________________
   127. How does an open-loop opamp behave? What type of circuit is it?
In open-loop configuration, an opamp behaves as a comparator, providing a digital output that switches between the supply voltage limits in response to the analog input voltage differences. This configuration utilizes the opamp's high gain in a non-linear mode for binary decision-making tasks.
________________


   128. Why are non-inverting configurations often preferred?
Non-inverting configurations are often preferred due to their high input impedance, which minimizes the current draw from the source. This makes it easier to interface with various signal sources without affecting their operation, ensuring signal integrity is maintained across a wide range of applications.

   131. What is the dropoff rate of a first-order low-pass filter?
For a filter that has an nth number order, it will have a subsequent roll-off rate of 20n dB/decade or 6n dB/octave. So a first-order filter has a roll-off rate of 20dB/decade (6dB/octave), a second-order filter has a roll-off rate of 40dB/decade (12dB/octave), and a fourth-order filter has a roll-off rate of 80dB/decade (24dB/octave),  etc.
________________




   132. What does the bandwidth characterize?
Bandwidth characterizes the range of frequencies over which a system or component can operate effectively, typically measured in hertz (Hz).
________________


   133. What is the 3dB rolloff point? What happens after that? How much of the signal gets through?
The 3dB rolloff point is where the output power is half its maximum value. Beyond this point, the filter attenuates the signal at its specified roll-off rate.

A PLL locks onto the frequency and phase of an input signal, using a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to match this signal. It adjusts the VCO based on the phase difference detected between the input and its output signal.
________________


   136. What blocks does a PLL have?
A PLL consists of a phase-frequency detector, a charge pump, a low-pass filter (loop filter), a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and a feedback path that may include frequency dividers.
________________


   137. Draw a block diagram.
  

________________


   138. What happens if your PLL locks too fast or too slow?
If a PLL locks too fast, it may overshoot the desired frequency and become unstable, causing jitter. If it locks too slow, it may fail to synchronize properly with the input signal, leading to poor performance or loss of lock.
________________


   139. Why is crushing the clock window bad? How can this impact other circuits that may be connected to the clock?
Crushing the clock window, which means reducing the time interval during which the clock signal is stable and at its correct level, can lead to timing violations. This can cause data corruption, erratic behavior, or failure in circuits relying on the clock, as these circuits may not have enough time to properly process or latch the data before the next clock cycle.

________________


   142. Often times on a power rail, there are many capacitors connected to ground. What are these capacitors and why are there so many? Why can you just put one massive capacitor?
These capacitors, often of various sizes, are used for decoupling and filtering. They help stabilize the voltage and filter out noise by providing a quick supply of current during transient loads. Using multiple capacitors instead of one large capacitor optimizes both high-frequency performance and bulk energy storage.

Inductive flyback is the voltage spike generated by an inductor when its current supply is suddenly interrupted. This phenomenon can be unwanted, causing potential damage to electronic components but can be desired in applications like DC-DC converters. It can be mitigated using flyback diodes or snubber circuits.
________________


   145. What is PWM? What are its characteristics?
PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) controls analog circuits with a digital output. Its key characteristics are the duty cycle, representing the proportion of time the signal is high, and frequency, affecting how fast the PWM completes one cycle. It's used for controlling power delivery, motor speed, and dimming lights.

   5. Buck-Boost Converters
________________


   157. What is the difference between a buck converter vs LDO? What are the tradeoffs?
A buck converter is more efficient for large voltage drops and variable loads due to its switching action, whereas an LDO has a simpler design and provides cleaner output but is less efficient for large voltage drops.
________________


   158. When can an LDO be more efficient than a buck converter?
An LDO can be more efficient when the voltage drop is small and the load current is low, minimizing the heat generated and possibly avoiding the need for a large heat sink.

Converters include AC-DC rectifiers for converting to direct current, DC-DC converters (buck, boost, buck-boost) for changing DC levels, DC-AC inverters for converting to alternating current, and AC-AC converters for direct AC level changes.
________________


   160. What is a bridge rectifier? How does it work?
Bridge Rectifiers use four diodes that are arranged cleverly to convert the AC supply voltage to a DC supply voltage. The output signal of such a circuit is always of the same polarity regardless of the polarities of the input AC signal.
________________


   161. In many embedded systems, why are step-down regulators more common than step-up regulators?
Step-down (buck) regulators are more common in embedded systems because these systems often operate at lower voltages than their power supplies. Buck regulators efficiently reduce higher input voltages to the lower operating voltages required by most semiconductor devices, making them a practical choice for powering embedded systems.

Efficiency


________________


   162. What is efficiency in a power supply? How can it be measured? Why is it important?
Efficiency in a power supply is the ratio of output power to input power, expressed as a percentage. It indicates how well the power supply converts the input electrical power into usable output power for the load. High efficiency is important because it means less energy is wasted as heat, leading to lower energy costs and reduced thermal management challenges.

   * If input power and efficiency are given, calculate output power as input power times efficiency.
   * If input and output powers are given, calculate efficiency as (output power / input power) * 100%.
   164. What happens to any lost power? Why is this bad?
Lost power in a power supply is mostly converted into heat. This is undesirable because it requires additional cooling measures, increases energy consumption, and can shorten the lifespan of components due to higher operating temperatures.

   171. What is power sequencing? When/why is it needed? How is the sequence determined? How much time between each rail turning on/off is needed?
Power sequencing is the controlled order in which different parts of an electronic system are powered up or down. It is necessary in systems with multiple voltage rails to ensure proper operation, prevent damage, and meet the power-up requirements of specific components. The sequence and timing are determined based on the dependencies between components and their initialization requirements. The time between each rail turning on or off varies based on the system's specifications and can range from microseconds to milliseconds.

   172. How can you implement power sequencing?
Power sequencing can be implemented using various methods, including discrete components (transistors, resistors, and capacitors), programmable power management ICs, or dedicated power sequencing chips. The choice depends on the complexity, cost, and flexibility requirements of the system. Programmable solutions offer the most flexibility for complex systems, allowing for easy adjustments and precise control over the power-up and power-down sequences.

The voltage of a battery is determined by the chemistry, the number of cells, and the state of charge.
________________


   179. What is a duty cycle?
A duty cycle or power cycle is the fraction of one period in which a signal or system is active. Duty cycle is commonly expressed as a percentage or a ratio. A period is the time it takes for a signal to complete an on-and-off cycle.


________________


   180. How to calculate duty cycle?
Determine the duty cycle, represented by "D," through the formula D = PW/T. As an example, if PW is 0.02 seconds and T is 0.05 seconds, then D = 0.02/0.05 = 0.4, or 40%.
________________


   181. What happens at 100% and 0% duty cycle?
100% duty cycle would be the same as setting the voltage to 5 Volts (high). 0% duty cycle would be the same as grounding the signal.


________________


   182. Given a Vout/Vin ratio, how can the duty cycle be calculated?
D = Vout / Vin for buck converter, D = 1 - Vin / Vout for boost converter
________________
   183. Given duty cycle and Vin, can you find Vout?

   184. What is a DC load-line? What are its tradeoffs?
The DC load line is the load line of the DC equivalent circuit, defined by reducing the reactive components to zero (replacing capacitors by open circuits and inductors by short circuits). It is used to determine the correct DC operating point, often called the Q point.
Trade-offs:
   1. Stability vs. Efficiency: The slope of the load line impacts both, with trade-offs between operating efficiency and circuit stability.
   2. Operating Range: Influences the device's linear operating range; improper positioning can limit performance.
   3. Sensitivity: Makes circuits sensitive to changes in supply voltage or component characteristics, potentially requiring stabilization.

   186. What is the purpose of the output inductor/capacitor?
The inductor supplies energy to the circuit to keep current flowing during the "off" switching periods and enables topographies where the output voltage is higher than the input voltage. A tuned circuit, consisting of an inductor connected to a capacitor, acts as a resonator for oscillating current.
________________


   187. What direction does current flow in the inductor/capacitor in the on and off states?
In an inductor:
On state: Current increases, flowing into the inductor.
Off state: Current decreases but continues in the same direction due to stored energy.


In a capacitor:
On state: Current flows in as the capacitor charges.
Off state: Current reverses, flowing out as the capacitor discharges.
________________


   188. Why is the inductor current a linear ramp? What determines this behavior?
   1. Typically, the analysis of switched mode power supplies is done in a piece-wise linear fashion. This means that the capacitor voltage is considered constant for the duration of a switching period, which would then cause the inductor current to look like a ramp.
   189. Why is the output capacitor voltage a linear ramp?
   1. The linear ramp circuit produces a voltage signal that steadily increases from zero at the rate of 25 volts per minute times the Ramp Rate dial setting.
   190. When does the output capacitor charge/discharge?
   1. Capacitor Discharge Calculation C = μF, RC = s = time constant. just after the switch is closed. The charge will start at its maximum value Qmax= μC.
   191. What is the inductor polarity?
   1. An inductor has a winding direction (polarity), and the marking is placed so that the polarity can be confirmed from its external appearance. Depending on usage conditions, the polarity of the inductor can affect the inductor's characteristics.
   192. When does the inductor sink/supply current?
   193. What is the input capacitor needed? What happens if it's removed?
   1. When designing with switching regulators, application requirements determine how much input an output capacitance is needed.
   194. What is voltage/current ripple? (from circuit analysis perspective)
   1. Ripple (specifically ripple voltage) in electronics is the residual periodic variation of the DC voltage within a power supply which has been derived from an alternating current (AC) source. This ripple is due to incomplete suppression of the alternating waveform after rectification. Ripple voltage originates as the output of a rectifier or from generation and commutation of DC power.
   195. What determines inductor current slope?
   196. What determines capacitor voltage slope?
   1. When the voltage plot line is rising quickly (steep slope), the current will likewise be large. Where the voltage plot has a mild slope, the current is small.
   197. Why is the diode needed? What if it's removed?
   1. Diodes are used in circuit protection due to their ability to restrict electrical current to flow in only one direction. This trait is useful because some electrical components and devices will be damaged or malfunction if current flows in the wrong direction.
   198. If the diode is replaced with an ideal diode, how does it impact performance?

   210. What can you do to decrease the effect of the internal body diode?
Efficiency, Ripple, and Switching Frequency
   211. Why are buck converters more efficient than LDOs?
   1.  It releases the energy to the load at a different voltage, and hence is highly efficient. Buck, or step-down converter provides lower voltage.
   212. How to size inductors/capacitors to meet ripple spec?
   1. To get a good compromise between inductor and capacitor size, you should choose a ripple current value of 10% to 30% of maximum load current. This also implies that the current in the inductor will be continuous for output currents greater that 5% to 15% of full load.
   213. Component-by-component analysis on efficiency and ripple impact.
   214. What are some ways to increase efficiency?
   215. What are some ways to decrease ripple?
   1. The ripple can be reduced by smoothing capacitors which converts the ripple voltage into a smoother dc voltage. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are widely used for this and have capacitances of 100uF or more. The repeated dc pulses charges the capacitor to the peak voltage.
   216. How does switching frequency impact efficiency/ripple?
   1. The higher the switching frequency, the smaller inductor and capacitor are needed, and a better dynamic performance can be achieved while it decreases the efficiency with the increase of switching frequency.
   217. What components are most responsible for efficiency losses?
   218. Why should ripple be decreased?
   1. Ripple is wasted power, and has many undesirable effects in a DC circuit: it heats components, causes noise and distortion, and may cause digital circuits to operate improperly.
   219. When does ripple not as matter as much?
   220. What limits the switching frequency on the upper and lower ends? Why can't the switching frequency be 1THz or 1Hz?
   221. How does switching frequency impact performance?
   1. The higher the switching frequency, the smaller inductor and capacitor are needed, and a better dynamic performance can be achieved while it decreases the efficiency with the increase of switching frequency
   222. How does dropout voltage impact efficiency, ripple, etc? What about output current an input/output voltage?
   1. Low dropout voltage is necessary to maximize the regulator efficiency
   2. Dropout voltage is the input-to-output differential voltage at which the circuit ceases to regulate against further reductions in input voltage
Voltage/Current Sensing
   223. How is the output voltage typically sensed? What network is typically used and why is it needed?
   1. A voltage sensor is a sensor used to calculate and monitor the amount of voltage in an object. Voltage sensors can determine the AC voltage or DC voltage level. The input of this sensor is the voltage, whereas the output is the switches, analog voltage signal, a current signal, or an audible signal.
   224. What happens if the voltage-sensing resistor divider has too high resistance? What if too low?
   1. One or more of the resistors in your voltage divider circuit is dissipating more power than it is rated for.
   225. How can the output current be sensed?
   1. The most common way to measure current is to sense the voltage drop across a shunt or current-sense resistor. To achieve a highly accurate measurement of the current, you'll need to examine the parametric values of both the resistor and current-sense amplifier.
   226. When should output current be sensed? Before or after the output inductor? Or somewhere else?
   227. Which voltages/currents are important to be considered in the control loop and for what purpose?
PFM Operation
   228. What are the different operation modes?
   1. Pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) is a modulation method for representing an analog signal using only two levels (1 and 0). It is analogous to pulse-width modulation (PWM), in which the magnitude of an analog signal is encoded in the duty cycle of a square wave. Unlike PWM, in which the width of square pulses is varied at a constant frequency, PFM fixes the width of square pulses while varying the frequency. In other words, the frequency of the pulse train is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal at sampling intervals. The amplitude and width of the pulses are kept constant.
   229. What is the difference between discontinuous and continuous operation?
   1. In discontinuous mode, there is a period in which the inductor current IL is interrupted, hence the name, discontinuous mode. In contrast, in continuous mode there is no period in which the inductor current is zero.
   230. What can you do to increase efficiency at light loads?
   1. Reducing the switching frequency at light loads reduces both switching losses and gate-driving losses and thus improves efficiency.
   231. Explain PFM operation.
   1. PFM mode is also referred to as power save mode in TI data sheets. A converter operating in power save mode uses PFM at light load currents and pulse width modulation (PWM) at heavier load currents. This type of operation allows the converter to maintain high efficiency over a wide range of output current.
   232. What is the difference between PFM and PWM?
   1. In pulse-width modulation (PWM), the frequency is constant, and duty cycle is used to control the voltage. PFM (pulse frequency modulation) operates with a fixed pulse on-time (or off-time) and performs control by varying the off-time (or on-time).
   233. How does the ripple compare between PFM and PWM?
   234. What happens to the inductor current?
   1. The current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously because it implies an infinite voltage will exist, which isn't going to happen. This reluctance to change is because of the energy stored in the inductor's magnetic field. The current in an inductor does not (will not) change instantaneously.
   235. Describe the charge/discharge cycle of inductor and capacitor.
   1. Inductor charge for half-cycle up to the peak voltage. When the first cycle ends the inductor start to discharge first.
Multiphase Buck Converters
   236. What is a multiphase buck converter?
   1. A multiphase buck regulator is a parallel set of buck power stages, each with its own inductor and set of power MOSFETs. Collectively, these components are called a phase. These phases are connected in parallel and share both input and output capacitors.
   237. What are the pros/cons/tradeoffs vs single-phase buck converters?
   1. There are a number of benefits to using multiphase buck converters, such as higher efficiency from lower transitional losses; lower output ripple voltage; better transient performance; and lower ripple-current-rating requirements for the input capacitor.
   238. How do they work and what challenges are presented?
   239. When should they be used?
   1. Single-phase buck controllers work well for low-voltage converter applications with cur- rents of up to approximately 25 A, but power dissipation and efficiency start to become an issue at higher currents. One suitable approach is to use a multiphase buck controller.
   240. How do they increase output current?

   245. What happens when a buck is stable/unstable/marginally stable? What about during load transients or noisy events?
   246. What type of system is the output LC filter?
   1. In higher-power class-D amplifiers, generally above 10 W of output power, a filter on the output of the amplifier is required. The filter is passive in nature and uses both an inductor and a capacitor on each output terminal. Therefore, it is referred to as an LC filter.
   247. How do inductor/capacitor values impact stability?
   248. Explain what happens during a load transient event.
   249. How is transient response characterized?
   1. In particular, for a constant input, rss, the steady-state component of the system response is given as: yss=T(0)rss. The transient response is characterized by the roots of the closed-loop characteristic polynomial, given as: Δ(s)=1+KGH(s). These roots can be real or complex, distinct or repeated
   250. What is a feedforward capacitor? When is it needed?
   1. The feedforward capacitor is a capacitor placed across the high-side feedback resistor to improve loop stability and transient performance. 
   251. Explain different control topologies.
   252. What is the difference between voltage-mode and current-mode control? Why are they often both implemented simultaneously?
   1. In classic voltage mode control, the voltage ramp to the PWM comparator is fixed, and is artificially generated from the clock. In current mode control, this ramp is the sensed inductor/switch current mapped into a proportional voltage ramp that is applied to the PWM comparator.
   253. Explain subharmonic oscillation.
   1. Sub-harmonic oscillation is normally characterized by observing alternating wide and narrow pulses at the switch node. For peak current mode control, sub-harmonic oscillation occurs with a duty cycle greater than 50%.
   254. When using peak current mode control, what happens when the duty cycle is less than 50% during noise events/load perturbations? What about when the duty cycle is greater than 50%?
   255. What is slope compensation and when is it needed?
   1. Slope compensation is needed if the following three conditions are met: (1) the switching is constant frequency, (2) the duty cycle is more than 50%, and (3) current mode control is used.

   256. What components are typically integrated in the IC and which are typically external?
   257. How do you select a buck converter IC?
   258. How should you spec the output inductor/capacitor? What about input capacitor? What are some considerations?
   259. Why is the inductor's saturation current important to consider? What about ACR vs DCR?
   1. Inductor manufacturers specify the saturation current for the typical temperature in data sheets, and not considering this might lead to having the wrong inductor in your application. The inductance vs. current curve changes over temperature, as you can see in Figure 4.
   2.   

      260. What determines minumum/maximum L/C?

      4. Bad Regulation
      5. Slow Transient Response

      267. How do you validate/characterize a buck converter? What properties/behaviors do you look out for?
      268. How does a buck converter age? What happens to its performance?
      269. How does buck performance vary with process, voltage, and temperature (PVT)?
      1.  A lower threshold voltage means a higher current and therefore a better delay performance. This effect depends extremely on the power supply, threshold voltage, load, and input slope of a cell.   
Boost Converters
Many of the boost converter questions can be similar to bucks, but I barely have any experience with boosts so they aren't covered as much in my interviews.
         270. What is a boost converter? How does it boost voltage?
         1. A boost converter (step-up converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter that steps up voltage (while stepping down current) from its input (supply) to its output (load).
         271. How does a boost converter work?
         1. This unique capability is achieved by storing energy in an inductor and releasing it to the load at a higher voltage.
         272. Draw a boost converter circuit.
  

         273. What are some applications?

         4. Battery power systems.
         5. Consumer Electronics.
         6. Communication Applications.
         274. Why are they less efficient than buck converters?
         1. With near-ideal components, they can achieve the same efficiency. However by their nature, boost converters tend to be used to produce higher voltages than a buck so for the same output power, boost converters operate at lower currents.
         275. What is the purpose of the diode? The inductor? The capacitor?
         1. The capacitor in the boost converter is for filtering purpose (The voltage across capacitor could not change suddenly). The inductor is where the "Boosted Energy" comes from. During switch ON stage, the source will charge the inductor.
         276. What happens to the inductor flyback voltage? Why is this important?
         1. When the circuit is interrupted for instance, the inductor will still try to maintain the current flowing by generating a very high voltage over its terminals.
Low-Dropout Regulators (LDOs)
         277. What does LDO stand for? What does "low-dropout" refer to? How can this be an advantage?
         1. LDO, which stands for Low Dropout, can operate at a low potential difference between input and output. It is sometimes referred to as a low-loss or saturation type linear regulator.
         278. How does an LDO work?
         1. A low-dropout regulator's (LDO) nature is to regulate a voltage by turning excess power into heat, making this integrated circuit a good fit for low-power or small VIN-to-VOUT differential applications.
         279. An LDO can often be modeled as a single passive component, what is this passive component?
         280. What are some tradeoffs of LDOs compared to other stepdown regulators?

Charge Pumps
         284. How does a charge pump work?
         1. Charge-pump voltage converters accomplish energy transfer and voltage conversion using charges stored on capacitors, thus the name, charge-pump. Using switching techniques, charge pumps convert supply voltage of one polarity to a higher or lower voltage, or to an alternate polarity (at either higher or lower voltage).
         285. How does a charge pump boost voltage?
         1. The charge pump uses capacitors as the energy-storage element. In the basic execution of this power-conversion technique, current (charge) is alternately switched and directed between two capacitors arranged so the circuit output is twice the input, and thus functioning as a voltage-doubling boost converter.
         286. Draw a circuit for a charge pump.
  



         287. What are they used for?

         294. How do you measure battery voltage/current?
         1. Connect the multimeter leads to the battery's terminals (red probe to the battery's positive terminal and black probe to the battery's negative terminal). Take the reading on the multimeter. If the reading shows a value greater than 7V for a 9V battery, the battery is still fit to use.
         295. What do you have to monitor in a battery to ensure it's operating safely?
         1. A voltmeter can be used to get a quick snapshot of the state of charge of any battery type. A fully charged 12 volt battery will have an open circuit voltage of around 12.6 volts depending on the type, and a battery is considered fully discharged when the voltage drops to 10.5 volts at the 20 hour discharge rate.
         296. How do you charge/discharge a battery safely?
         1. Always wear protective eyewear and gloves
         2. Eliminate sources of sparks or flames
         3. Keep metal tools and jewelry away from batteries
         4. Use caution when removing a lead-acid battery
         5. Keep a neutralizing solution close by
         6. Use the correct type of charger
Lithium Polymer (LiPo)
         297. What is the common battery chemistry used in rechargeable consumer electronics? Why?
         1. Lithium-Ion batteries have, by far, become the most common rechargeable batteries for consumer electronic applications due to their high energy densities, moderate to high cell voltages, and low weight when compared to other battery chemistries.
         298. What does LiPo stand for? What does this mean?
         1. A lithium polymer battery, or more correctly lithium-ion polymer battery (abbreviated as LiPo, LIP, Li-poly, lithium-poly and others), is a rechargeable battery of lithium-ion technology using a polymer electrolyte instead of a liquid electrolyte. High conductivity semisolid (gel) polymers form this electrolyte. These batteries provide higher specific energy than other lithium battery types and are used in applications where weight is a critical feature, such as mobile devices, radio-controlled aircraft and some electric vehicles
         299. What are some tradeoffs of a LiPo compared to other batteries?
         300. What are some other common Lithium-based battery chemistries? What are their tradeoffs?
         301. Can LiPos be used forever? What happens as they age?
         1. LiPo batteries don’t have expiration dates, but they can see a drop in performance after excessive use or passed time.
         2. LiPo batteries show a significant drop in performance after 12 to 18 months
         302. What materials are LiPos made out of?
         1. A lithium-polymer battery (LiPo) is a rechargeable battery that, in the case of true LiPo, uses solid polymer for the electrolyte and lithium for one of the electrodes. Commercially available LiPo are hybrids: gel polymer or liquid electrolyte in a pouch format, more accurately termed a lithium ion polymer battery.
         303. What is the internal resistance? Why is it important? How does it vary with temperature, aging, frequency, etc?
         1. The resistance in a battery is called internal resistance. As explained in my LiPo battery beginner's guide, IR determines how effectively a battery can deliver current to your quadcopter. Higher IR means lower performance, and more energy is wasted as heat, that's why it gets hot during charging and discharging.
         304. What is a battery management system? What features does it offer?
         1. A battery management system is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery, such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area, monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or balancing it.
Monitoring
         305. What is the typical cell voltage of a LiPo? What are its ranges and why?
         1. The usable voltage range for a standard lipo battery cell is 3.2v to 4.2v. Any lower than 3.2v and the battery may be permanently damaged.
         306. How does temperature impact LiPo performance?
         1. LiPo batteries and cold temps don't mix well. The discharge rating of a LiPo battery is directly affected by the temperature of the battery. When the temperature of the battery is below 50° F (10° C), you'll start to notice performance drops; significant issues start to occur when the battery gets below 20° F (-7° C).
         307. What important characteristics do you want to monitor in a LiPo circuit?
         308. How can you determine the state of charge (SoC)? Why is this often so difficult?
         1. The SOC of a battery, that is, its remaining capacity, can be determined using a discharge test under controlled conditions. The voltage method converts a reading of the battery voltage to the equivalent SOC value using the known discharge curve (voltage vs. SOC) of the battery.
         309. Why is SoC measurement accuracy so important?
         1. As the battery SOC is an important parameter, which reflects the battery performance, so accurate estimation of SOC cannot only protect battery, prevent overcharge or discharge, and improve the battery life, but also let the application make rationally control strategies to achieve the purpose of saving energy.
         310. When it SoC measurement accuracy more desired? When does it not matter as much?
         311. How is capacity measured?
         1. The primary method most commonly used is simply measuring the LiPo's voltage at any point in time. The less remaining capacity a LiPo has the lower the voltage it can deliver. Fully charged cells tend to be 4.2v each while anything close to 3.0v signifies a dead battery.
         312. How can you determine the health of a LiPo?
         1. Internal resistance of both the LiPo battery and the individual cells within the battery is one of the very best ways to monitor your RC LiPo battery's condition. By comparing brand new IR readings of the cells to ones you take thereafter as your LiPo pack/s age, you will have useful new vs. old condition data.
         313. Why are charging/monitoring ICs important? What can they do?
         314. What is cell balancing? Why is it important and when is it needed? What happens if it's not implemented?
         1. Battery balancing and battery redistribution refer to techniques that improve the available capacity of a battery pack with multiple cells and increase each cell's longevity. A battery balancer or battery regulator is an electrical device in a battery pack that performs battery balancing
Charging/Discharging
         315. What is a LiPo's C rating?
         1. The C rating for a LiPo battery, quite simply, refers to the capacity of energy the battery can safely discharge, represented as a multiple of its overall capacity. A battery that has a higher C rating delivers more energy, and that means higher performance
         316. Explain the LiPo discharge and charge curve.
         1. This charge curve of a Lithium-ion cell plots various parameters such as voltage, charging time, charging current and charged capacity.
         317. When do LiPos charge fastest?
         318. How fast can you safely charge a LiPo?
         1. The safest way to charge a lipo battery and the one that puts the least amount of strain on your battery is to charge at a rate of "1C" or 1 times capacity. A 1C charge rate means that the current will charge the entire battery in 1 hour ( assuming you are starting with a fully discharged battery around 3.2v ).
         319. What happens when you overcharge the battery?
         1. As a result of too high a charge voltage excessive current will flow into the battery, after the battery has reached full charge. This will cause decomposition of the water in the electrolyte and premature aging. At high rates of overcharge a battery will progressively heat up.
         320. How do you charge a LiPo? What steps and precautions are needed?
         1. The safest way to charge a lipo battery and the one that puts the least amount of strain on your battery is to charge at a rate of "1C" or 1 times capacity. A 1C charge rate means that the current will charge the entire battery in 1 hour ( assuming you are starting with a fully discharged battery around 3.2v ).
         321. What are the constant-current and constant-voltage procedures in the charge curve?
         1. Constant current and constant voltage charging(CC-CV) uses constant current to charge firstly, until the power battery voltage reaches the preset value, and then switches to constant voltage charging. Finally, the termination condition is that the charging current reaches the cut-off current value.
         322. What should you monitor when charging a LiPo?
         1. It is also important to monitor the voltage of each cell in your battery from time to time. All lipo chargers that are capable of charging 2s or greater batteries should show you the voltage of each cell of the battery.
         323. Design a circuit to charge/discharge a LiPo.
         324. What is storage charging?
         1. This partial charge is called the Storage Voltage. Storage voltage is where each cell is charged to approximately 3.8 volts. (Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with battery cells, we will get more into that later). The reason for this is that a lipo battery is most stable at that voltage.
         325. Why are charging/monitoring ICs important? What can they do?
         1. Battery management ICs also ensure safety by monitoring cell temperatures during use and charging and cutting energy if temperature limits are reached.
         326. What is balance charging? When is it needed?
         1. A balance charger has a balance connector slot in addition to the main power connectors. This allows the charger to read the voltage for each cell and adjust its charging accordingly so that all cells are charged evenly, with no voltage differences. This will prolong the lifespan of your battery
Safety
         327. What are the dangers of Lithium-based battery chemistries? How can these be prevented?
         1. ​​Lithium-ion cells with cobalt cathodes (same as the recalled laptop batteries) should never rise above 130°C (265°F). At 150°C (302°F) the cell becomes thermally unstable, a condition that can lead to a thermal runaway in which flaming gases are vented.
         328. Why is it important to properly handle and dispose LiPos?
         1. It is a really bad idea. The stuff inside is potentially hazardous and it could lead to fire, smoke and poisoning. For safe disposal, discharge a discarded LiPo to 2 V/cell or below at a recommended rate of no more than 0.5C.
         329. Why is it so dangerous to puncture LiPos?
         1. A punctured lithium-ion battery can lead to a serious fire in some cases. Potent electrolytes can leak through the hole, often creating unsafe chemical reactions. 
         330. What happens if you overdischarge/overcharge a LiPo?
         1. One of the most common ways that LiPo batteries are abused is in how people overcharge their batteries. If users leave their batteries charged for too long, the batteries can become damaged, performance can be lost, and the life span of the batteries can decrease.
         331. What happens when you short circuit a LiPo?
         1. If the LiPo hasn't swelled, the damage, if any, isn't going to make the LiPo dangerous - it merely degrades its capacity and shortens its life
         332. Why is heat such a big concern?
         1. When temperatures reach 130°F, a lithium battery will increase its voltage and storage density for a short time. However, this increase in performance comes with long-term damage. The battery's life will reduce drastically, which can happen at a slower pace if the batteries operate consistently at even 100°F
Inductive Loads
Mostly on DC inductive loads like brushed DC motors and solenoids. I've only been asked a tiny bit of AC inductive loads in the context of brushless motors. Most of these questions arise because of my personal projects with motors and solenoids, only a few roles I've interviewed for actually use motors/solenoids. I was also asked most of these questions during my freshman year before I started taking interview notes and before I had any internship or school experience, so these questions are mostly from memory. Most of these questions will be for motors (since I've been asked mostly about them), but there's a good amount of overlap with solenoids.
         333. What is a motor/solenoid? What can they be used for?
         1. An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates with a reversed flow of power, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy
         2. A solenoid is a type of electromagnet formed by a helical coil of wire whose length is substantially greater than its diameter, which generates a controlled magnetic field. The coil can produce a uniform magnetic field in a volume of space when an electric current is passed through it. The term solenoid was coined in 1823 by André-Marie Ampère.
         334. Describe how a motor/solenoid works.
         1. Electric motors work by converting electrical energy to mechanical energy in order to create motion. Force is generated within the motor through the interaction between a magnetic field and winding alternating (AC) or direct (DC) current.
         2. A solenoid works by producing an electromagnetic field around a movable core, called an armature. When compelled to move by the electromagnetic field, the motion of that armature opens and closes valves or switches and turns electrical energy into mechanical motion and force
         335. Why are coils often used? What is so special about that configuration?
         1. Electronic Electric Coils are used in various applications because they have several properties that make them ideal for these applications. First, they have a high resistance to current flow. This makes them suitable for use in transformers, which are used to step up or down the voltage.
Characterization/Behavior
         336. When does a motor/solenoid draw the most current?
         1.  All DC motors will draw higher current when the rotor is stopped (“locked-rotor current”). This is because every DC motoer also functions as a generator
         337. When does a motor/solenoid draw the least amount of current?
         1. Either the motor is running at below the rated load, in this case as the motor is not delivering the rated power it is supposed to deliver, it will result in lower efficiency. On the other hand if the motor runs at a voltage higher to its rated limit, then the current will be drawn less.
         338. Describe what happens to a motor/solenoid at steady-state under minimum and maximum current draw.
         339. What type of loads are motors/solenoids?
         1. Any devices or equipment that have coils in them are inductive in nature. Examples of inductive load are motors, solenoids, contactor coils, compressors, speakers, relays, transformers, inductors, power generators, etc.
         340. What is flyback voltage?
         1. A “Flyback Voltage Spike” occurs when the supply current to an inductive load such as a solenoid is interrupted. Any switching circuit for highly inductive loads should have flyback voltage protection to limit the voltage rise from the discharging coil and damage to the relay contacts.
         341. What is back EMF?
         1. Counter-electromotive force, is the electromotive force manifesting as a voltage that opposes the change in current which induced it. CEMF is the EMF caused by electromagnetic induction
         342. If I hook up a 12V supply (with infinite current output) to a motor/solenoid with a coil resistance of 1 ohm, will I see 12A of curent being draw? Why? When would I see 12A? When wouldn't I?
         343. What is in rush current?
         1. Inrush current, input surge current, or switch-on surge is the maximal instantaneous input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Alternating-current electric motors and transformers may draw several times their normal full-load current when first energized, for a few cycles of the input waveform.
         344. When do motors/solenoids draw the most amount of current?
         1. A motor will draw much more current when stalled than when running
         345. Inductors oppose instantaneous changes in current, but motors/solenoid still experience very fast and large inrush currents. Why is this?
Brushed DC Motors
         346. What is the difference between a motor and generator?
         1. Converting energy from one form to another is the key to understanding the differences between electric motors and generators. An electric motor converts electricity into mechanical energy, providing a power source for machinery. A generator does the opposite of this, converting mechanical energy into electricity.
         347. What is the difference between a motor and solenoid?
         1. Solenoids are good for sliding levers, locking or unlocking doors, advancing a switch one position at a time mechanically. Motors are good for generating spinning axles for powering wheels, drills, electric screwdrivers or oscillating fans... and myriad other inventions.
         348. What are the parts of a motor? Which parts rotate and which parts remain static?
         1. A power supply – mostly DC for a simple motor.
         2. Field Magnet – could be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet.
         3. An Armature or rotor.
         4. Commutator.
         5. Brushes.
         6. Axle.
         349. Name a few types of motors. What are they each used for?
         1. AC Brushless Motors. AC brushless motors are some of the most popular in motion control
         2. DC Brushed Motors. In a DC brushed motor, brush orientation on the stator determines current flow 
         3. DC Brushless Motors 
         4. Direct Drive 
         5. Linear Motors 
         6. Servo Motors 
         7. Stepper Motors
         350. What are linear motors?
         1. A linear motor is an electric motor that has had its stator and rotor "unrolled", thus, instead of producing a torque, it produces a linear force along its length. However, linear motors are not necessarily straight.
         351. What sort of motors are typically used for phone's vibration motor?
         1. The most widely used cell phone vibration motor in the market is ERM motor.
         352. Draw a torque vs RPM curve. What are its implications? Repeat for current and voltage vs torque and RPM.
  

         353. What electrical parameter corresponds to high torque? Why? What about high RPM?
         1. Voltage is proportional to speed, and torque is proportional to the current.
         354. How do you spec a motor?
         1. Divide the motor speed by the required speed and round down to get a starting gear ratio. Then divide the required torque by the gear ratio to find the newly required torque. This will help you narrow the choices down to a few select motors
         355. Why are motors so noisy? How can you reduce this noise?
         1. The sources of mechanical noise in a motor include a loose stator core; worn, damaged or poorly lubricated bearings; and rubbing of internal components. Additionally, any structural part of the motor that is excited at its natural frequency can become the source of airborne noise.
         356. What is arcing?
         1. Electrical arcing is when electricity jumps from a one connection to another. This flash of electricity reaches temperatures of 35,000°F. Arcing can and will cause a fire in your home. Have you ever heard a light switch or outlet buzzing? This is arcing.
Brushes
         357. What are brushes?
         1. A brush or carbon brush is an electrical contact which conducts current between stationary wires and moving parts, most commonly in a rotating shaft. Typical applications include electric motors, alternators and electric generators.
         358. What are brushes made out of?
         1. Exact composition of the brush depends on the application. Graphite/carbon powder is commonly used. Copper is used for better conductance (rare for AC applications). In order to maximize electrical conductivity and green strength, highly dendritic (electrolytic) copper powder is used.
         359. What are some concerns about brushes?
         360. Why do brushes wear out?
         1. Low Spring Pressure: Inadequate spring pressure can cause rapid electrical brush wear. Clock and finger style springs tend to lose force as the brush wears, and all springs will fatigue over the course of time. This will reduce the effective force at the brush face and increase the rate of brush wear.
         361. When should you replace brushes vs replace the whole motor?
         1. When it gets down to 3/16 inches, the brush assembly should be replaced. But if the armature is pitted or the bearing is wobbly, then replace the motor. Motors are made to be replaced after 800-900 hours of use.
         362. How do brushes maintain contact with the commutator?
         1. A spring is typically used with the brush, to maintain constant contact with the commutator.
Brushless DC (BLDC) Motors
         363. How do BLDC motors work?
         1. These motors work by means of the mechanical linkage between their commutator and brushes. A brushless DC motor is essentially flipped inside out, eliminating the need for brushes to flip the electromagnetic field.
         364. How do you control BLDC motors?
         1. In a typical arrangement, the high-side MOSFETs are controlled using pulse-width modulation (PWM) which converts the input DC voltage into a modulated driving voltage. The use of PWM allows the start-up current to be limited and offers precise control over speed and torque
         365. How do you control a BLDC motor from a microcontroller? What other components do you need?
         1. The main responsibility of the controller is to energize the Phase wires of the BLDC motors in an order so that the motor rotates
         366. What are some advantages of brushless vs brushed motors?
         1. Brushless motors have significantly higher efficiency and performance, and a lower susceptibility to mechanical wear than their brushed counterparts. Brushless motors offer several other advantages, including: Higher torque to weight ratio. Increased torque per watt of power input (increased efficiency)
         367. What are the poles of the motor? How can they impact performance?
         1. The pole count of a motor is the number of permanent magnetic poles, north and south, on the rotor. There is always the same number of north and south poles on the rotor. For example, in a 12 pole motor, there are 6 north poles and 6 south poles. This motor would also be considered a 6 pole-pair motor.
         368. How do you spec a BLDC motor?
         1. Torque- brushless DC motor torque levels vary based on the operating condition.
Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)
         369. What is an electronic speed controller (ESC)?
         1. An electronic speed control is an electronic circuit that controls and regulates the speed of an electric motor. It may also provide reversing of the motor and dynamic braking. Miniature electronic speed controls are used in electrically powered radio controlled modelsAn electronic speed control is an electronic circuit that controls and regulates the speed of an electric motor. It may also provide reversing of the motor and dynamic braking. Miniature electronic speed controls are used in electrically powered radio controlled models.
         370. Why are ESCs often required for brushless motors?
         1. As we've learned, the role of the ESC is to deliver power from the battery to the motor in a controlled manner. If you input 50% throttle on the controller, the ESC will deliver 50% 'power' to the motor.
         371. What is the difference between an ESC and a single-phase motor driver? What additional functionality may an ESC offer?
         1. An ESC also converts a servo control signals (~1to2ms pulses @ 60 Hz) to something more appropriate to motor speed control. A motor driver such as an H-bridge simply provides a way to connect/disconnect each motor connection to a power supply rail through transistors.
         372. What components/subsystems does an ESC have?
         373. How do you interface with ESCs? What other components/controllers are needed? How do they communicate?
         374. Design an ESC.
         375. How do you spec an ESC?
Stepper Motors
         376. What is a stepper motor?
         1. A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps.
         377. How does it work?
         1. The stepper motor converts a pulsing electrical current, controlled by a stepper motor driver, into precise one-step movements of this gear-like toothed component around a central shaft. Each of these stepper motor pulses moves the rotor through one precise and fixed increment of a full turn.
         378. What are its applications?
         1. Commercially, stepper motors are used in floppy disk drives, flatbed scanners, computer printers, plotters, slot machines, image scanners, compact disc drives, intelligent lighting, camera lenses, CNC machines, and 3D printers.
         379. What are its advantages compared to other types of motors?
         1. One of the biggest advantages of stepper motors is their relatively low cost and availability. Stepper motors offer flexibility in application for a wide range of applications because the design of the stepper motor provides a constant holding torque without the need for the motor to be powered
         380. How do you control a stepper motor from a microcontroller? What other components do you need?
         381. How do you spec a stepper motor?
         382. How do stepper motors hold a certain position?
         1. One feature of stepper motors that differentiates them from other motor types — particularly servo motors — is that they exhibit holding torque. This means that when the windings are energized but the rotor is stationary, the motor can hold the load in place.
Servo Motors
         383. What is a servo motor?
         1. A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.
         384. How does it work?
         1.  A servo motor is an electromechanical device that produces torque and velocity based on the supplied current and voltage. A servo motor works as part of a closed loop system providing torque and velocity as commanded from a servo controller utilizing a feedback device to close the loop.
         385. What are its applications?
         1. Servo motors are utilized by items that are used every day. Home electronic devices like DVD and Blu-ray Disc players use servos to extract and retract disc trays. Automobiles also use servo motors. In modern cars, servo motors are used to control its speed.
         386. What are its advantages compared to other types of motors?
         1. High efficiency.
         2. High output power relative to their size.
         3. More constant torque at higher speed.
         4. Closed-loop control.
         5. Quiet operation.
         6. Highly reliable.
         7. High ratio of torque to inertia.
         8. High acceleration.
         387. How do you control a servo motor from a microcontroller? What other components do you need?
         388. How do you spec a servo motor?
         1. Divide the motor speed by the required speed and round down to get a starting gear ratio. Then divide the required torque by the gear ratio to find the new required torque. This will narrow the choices down to just a couple of motors.
         389. How are servo motors so precise in their movement?
         1. Servos are controlled by sending an electrical pulse of variable width, or pulse width modulation (PWM), through the control wire. There is a minimum pulse, a maximum pulse, and a repetition rate. A servo motor can usually only turn 90° in either direction for a total of 180° movement.
Safety and Monitoring

         2. Voltage imbalance.
         3. Harmonic distortion.
         4. Reflections on drive output PWM signals.
         5. Sigma current.
         6. Operational overloads.
         7. Misalignment.
         8. Shaft imbalance.
         2. Solenoids
         1. Manual Override.
         2. Damage to armature tube.
         3. Residual magnetism in the magnetic circuit of the solenoid coil.
         4. Damage or inversion in the seats.
         5. Absence of some components.
         391. What are some dangers when using motors/solenoids?
         1. To avoid fire, injury or electric shock, do not use the motor in an explosive, flammable or wet location. To avoid electric shock or injury, all wiring, inspection and installation should be done by a professional. To avoid electric shock or injury, do not move, wire, or inspect the motor while applying current.
         392. What properties do you want to measure when using a motor/solenoid?
         393. How can these properties be monitored? What sensors/components can you use?
         394. How would you alter the behavior of the motor/solenoid based on the observed data?
         395. How do you determine how much current a motor/solenoid is drawing?
         1. To calculate the full load current or the amperage of a 3-phase motor, First, know your motor's specifications including the power rating (P), voltage requirement (V), power factor (cosΦ), and efficiency (η). If P is in kW, use this equation: amperage = 1000 × P / (1.73205 × V × cosΦ × η).
         396. How can you detect the temperature of a motor/solenoid?
         1. The best way to determine if a motor is running within a safe operating temperature is to monitor its winding temperature with temperature sensors like thermostats or resistance temperature detectors
         397. Which temperatures do you want to/can you measure?
         1. Determining that crucial temperature requires one to know the motor's ambient temperature rating and its rated temperature rise above ambient.
         398. Since the motor/solenoid may be moving, you might not always want physical contact between the sensor and motor/solenoid. What are some contactless ways to measure temperature?
         399. How do motors perform as they age?
         1. Age-related changes in the motor unit lead to reduced maximal strength (up to 50% of young adult strength by 80 years), slower velocity of contraction and movement, marked reductions in muscle power, and increased fatigability when muscle is required to contract rapidly.
         400. What kind of stress may a motor experience in its lifetime?
         401. Motor/solenoids often require many loops in the coils, so the coil wires will be very thin. Motors/solenoids also draw lots of current, possibly more than the coils can support. How do you reconcile this? Do coils on the motors always burn out?
Speed/Position
         402. When/why would knowing the speed and/or position of a motor/solenoid be useful?
         403. How can you measure the RPM of a motor?
         1. To calculate RPM for an AC induction motor, you multiply the frequency in Hertz (Hz) by 60 — for the number of seconds in a minute — by two for the negative and positive pulses in a cycle. You then divide by the number of poles the motor has: (Hz x 60 x 2) / number of poles = no-load RPM.
         404. How can you determine the position of a motor?
         1. There are options for measuring every type of movement; either directly in the motor or by looking at an output i.e. position of a gear.
         405. What is a rotary encoder? How can it be used to measure motor speed?
         1. A rotary encoder, also called a shaft encoder, is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to analog or digital output signals. There are two main types of rotary encoder: absolute and incremental.
         406. How can you measure the speed of a solenoid?
         1. The most effective method of measuring the solenoid current is to measure the voltage across a resistive shunt connected in series with the solenoid, the battery, and the switch. There are several different ways to configure this series circuit for switching and voltage measurement.
         407. How can you measure the position of a solenoid?
         408. How can you use BEMF to measure motor/solenoid speed?
         1. The back EMF is directly related to the speed of the motor, so knowing the value of back EMF allows us to calculate the speed of that motor. We can represent the motor as a series connection of resistance, inductance and the back EMF voltage source. It is this voltage source that we want to measure.
Single-Phase Inductive Drives
PCB design/layout on inductive drives is in the PCBs section.
         409. How do you drive an inductive load?
         1.  An inductive load converts current into a magnetic field. Inductive reactance resists the change to current, causing the circuit current to lag voltage. Examples of devices producing reactive/inductive loads include motors, transformers and chokes
         410. What if you need motor braking?
         1. Plugging induction motor braking is done by reversing the phase sequence of the motor
         411. What if you need to drive the motor in both directions?
         412. What are the different kinds of motor braking?
         1. Three of the most commonly used types of brakes are DC brakes, three-phase brakes, and single-phase solenoid or linkage brakes, although there are other types available.
         413. What sort of protection circuitry do you need?
         414. Tradeoffs between different drive circuits: electromechanical relay (EMR), solid-state relay (SSR), MOSFET, BJT, insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), etc.
         415. What optimizations can you do for solenoid drives to increase plunger velocity and cycle rate?
         416. If you're using a driver IC, how do you spec it? What properties should you look for?
         417. If you're designing a motor/solenoid drive with discrete components, how do you spec your transistors?
         418. What limits the switching frequency?
         1. As demand for higher power densities increase, the frequencies increase, but so do the associated losses such as the switching losses that occur every time the device turns on. These losses therefore put a limit on the practical maximum switching frequency.
         419. How do you increase the switching frequency?
Half/H-Bridge
There's a good amount of overlap with the Power Bridge subsection of Buck Converters as well, since the power bridge of a buck is often just a half bridge.
         420. Draw an H-bidge circuit.
  

         421. Draw a half-bidge circuit.
  

         422. How does a half/H-Bridge work?
         1. An H-Bridge is made up of four switches: two in series, and two in parallel, with the load placed in between the switches. In this configuration the circuit takes an “H” shape. In order to change the direction of the voltage supplied, the H-Bridge controls the switches that deliver power to the load ( S1 ).
         2. In the half H-Bridge circuit, the enable switch is driven by a PWM signal. Different frequencies of PWM signals will let more or less current through the motor on average, increasing or decreasing the speed.
         423. What is the difference between an H-bridge and half-bridge? What are the tradeoffs?
         1. Often "Half-bridges" are used where you'd expect an H-Bridge. They are almost the same - but only the left (or right) part of the Bridge is already connected. (2 switches in series with their middle as output. Out of two half-bridges you can build an H-Bridge (also often referred to as Full-Bridge).
         424. How can you brake a motor using a half-bridge? What about an H-bridge? Which can brake the motor faster? How does this stress the motor?
         1. Using an H-bridge, you can stop the DC motor at a certain position by applying a 0101 or 1010 signal to the 4 terminals. You can also stop it at a certain position by driving it forward then backward at very high frequency which make the 'juggling' unnoticed and the motor looks like stationary
         425. When can you use an asymmetrical half-bridge? When do you need a symmetrical H-bridge?
         426. What are the advantages of using a high-side NFET? What additional challenges are presented?
         427. Design a circuit to properly drive a high-side NFET. Why is it needed?
         428. What happens if you turn both the PFET and NFET on the same side at the same time? How do you prevent this?1
Control from Embedded Device
Often times you want to control a big motor/solenoid from a small embedded device. This section focuses on some of the more power electronics side of things while the Embedded Systems section will focus a bit more on the embedded side of things.
         429. Design a circuit to drive an inductive load from a microcontroller GPIO.
         430. Why would a pulldown resistor be necessary?
         1. To control the current flow, we need those pull-down or pull up resistors. A pull-up resistor allow controlled current flow from supply voltage source to the digital input pins, where the pull-down resistors could effectively control current flow from digital pins to the ground
         431. Why would you want a series resistor between the GPIO and MOSFET gate? What is parasitic oscillation in the context and where can it arise from? What does the series resistor do?
         1. The series resistor slows the switching of the MOSFET (which reduces the drive current and EMI at the expense of a bit of switching loss on each transistion) and can provide a certain amount of protection for the driving circuit if the MOSFET becomes shorted gate-to-drain.
         432. Why is isolation important? What are the tradeoffs?
         1. Isolation allows the systems that supervise, monitor and protect the battery cells to safely and accurately communicate back to the central microcontroller, which operates at a different voltage.”
         433. What sort of isolations would you want?
         434. What is opto-isolation? What are its tradeoffs?
         1. An opto-isolator is an electronic component that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light. Opto-isolators prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal
         435. Describe/draw/design an opto-isolation circuit.
  

         436. What is galvanic isolation?
         1. Galvanic isolation is a principle of isolating functional sections of electrical systems to prevent current flow; no direct conduction path is permitted. Energy or information can still be exchanged between the sections by other means, such as capacitive, inductive, radiative, optical, acoustic or mechanical.
         437. What are some challenges when using a high-side PFET and a much higher supply voltage to power the motor?
         438. Design a circuit to properly drive a high-side PFET. Why is this needed?
  

Current Sensing
         439. How can you measure current?
         1. It is measured in the unit of the Ampere, simply called “Amp,” (A). The most common way to measure current in a circuit is to break the circuit open and insert an “ammeter” in series (in-line) with the circuit so that all electrons flowing through the circuit also have to go through the meter.
         440. Why do you want to measure current?
         1. If there were no measuring instruments, it would be difficult to pinpoint problems during maintenance and when equipment breaks down. For this reason, measuring current is an important part of maintaining electronic devices and pinpointing the causes of malfunctions and failures.
         441. How does inductive/magnetic current sensing work? What are its pros and cons?
         1. Inductive sensors use a coil through which a current-carrying wire passes.This causes power to flow in the coil that is proportional to the current. This happens because of the magnetic field produced by flowing current. Inductive sensors are used for AC currents
         442. Describe tradeoffs between different current sensing mechanisms.
Sense Resistor
Sense resistor PCB layout/routing is in PCB Design/Layout section
         443. How does a sense resistor work to sense current?
         1. A current sensing resistor is designed for low resistance so as to minimize power consumption. As a result, the calibrated resistance senses the current flowing through it in the form of a voltage drop which is detected and monitored by the control circuitry.
         444. What are its pros and cons?
         445. How do you spec a current sense resistor? What happens if it's too big/small?
         446. Given a range of input currents and ADC input voltage range, find an appropriate sense resistor value.
         447. What is the difference between high-side and low-side current sensing? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each? When do you need to use one vs the other?
         1. In the low-side configuration, the current sense resistor (Rshunt) is placed between the ground terminal of the power supply and the ground terminal of the load. 
         2. With the high-side method, the shunt resistor is placed between the positive terminal of the power supply and the supply input of the load
         448. How can you use drain-source measurements of a MOSFET to determine current? What are the pros and cons of this setup?
         1. To measure Drain-Source leakage current of a MOSFET, at first, short Gate pin and Source pin, and then, apply maximum allowable voltage on Drain-Source and monitor the leakage current of Drain- Source.
Current Sense Amplifiers (CSA)
         449. What is a current sense amplifier (CSA)?
         1. Current sense amplifiers are special-purpose amplifiers that output a voltage proportional to the current flowing in a power rail. They utilize a "current-sense resistor" to convert the load current in the power rail to a small voltage, which is then amplified by the current-sense amplifiers
         450. When do you need a CSA?
         451. What is the difference between a CSA and a regular opamp?
         452. How do you spec a CSA?
         453. Given a range of input currents, a sense resistor value, and ADC input voltage range, find an appropriate CSA gain.
Current/Voltage Protection
         454. How/why do you want to protect against overcurrent and/or over/undervoltage conditions?
         455. Design a circuit to detect overcurrent and/or over/undervoltage conditions.
         456. If an overcurrent and/or over/undervoltage condition is detected, what can you do?
         1. Fuses, circuit breakers, or fusible links are the most commonly used methods to provide overcurrent protection to a circuit or the internal wiring of a piece of equipment. Breakers, fuses, and fusible links generally function as conductors and add a negligible amount of resistance to the total circuit.
         457. How/why do you need to protect a power supply from overcurrent/overvoltage?
         1. A fuse protects the supply if the load-path short circuits or begins to draw too much current. A fuse may not be needed, as many supplies “self-limit” because they can only supply up to a certain amount of current.
         2. OCP is important because high currents can melt the PSU's cables and connectors and damage the corresponding regulator circuits.
         458. What happens if you get an over/undervoltage on an embedded system?
         1. Overvoltage can cause damage to components connected to the power supply and lead to insulation failure, damage to electronic components, heating, flashovers, etc.
         459. How can you protect a load from pulling too much current?
         1. Fuses. A fuse is a simple device that protects the conductors and equipment of a circuit from damage due to higher than normal fault values.

         5. A PCB has a cleaner look than a breadboard (when manufactured correctly).
         462. What is the difference between a PCB and IC?
         1. The integrated circuit (IC) is soldered on the PCB; the PCB version is the carrier of the integrated circuit (IC). The PCB board is a printed circuit board (PCB). Printed circuit boards appear in almost every electronic device.
         463. What are the parasitic elements present on a PCB?
         1. On circuit boards, resistance and reactance, which can be either predominantly inductive or capacitive, can show up in unwanted places. These are referred to as parasitics.

         4. Rigid PCBs.
         5. Flex PCBs.
         6. Rigid-Flex PCBs.
         465. What is a flex PCB? What are its tradeoffs and applications?
         1. A flexible printed circuit consists of a metallic layer of traces, usually copper, bonded to a dielectric layer, usually polyimide. Thickness of the metal layer can be very thin (<. 0001″) to very thick (> . 010″) and the dielectric thickness can vary as well.
Layers and Materials
         466. What are the layers of a PCB? What are they made of?
         1. Substrate Layer. The substrate layer of any PCB is usually made from fiberglass, which gives the board its rigid form. 
         2. Copper Layer. Next is a thin layer of copper foil which is laminated to the board using heat.
         3. Soldermask layer 
         4. Silkscreen layer
         467. What material would I want for conduction layers?
         468. What are the tradeoffs of using gold vs copper on the conduction layers?
         1. Gold is used on PCBs over other metals for the combination of the following reasons: Conducts Electricity Efficiently – its high conductivity is essential for PCB applications. Does Not Corrode – silver and copper also have high conductivity, but they corrode easily, which affects efficiency over time
         469. What materials are often used for the insulation materials? What are their tradeoffs?
         1. Materials that serve as effective substrates include fiberglass, Teflon, ceramics and certain polymers. The most popular substrate today is probably FR-4. FR-4 is a fiberglass-epoxy laminate that is affordable, a good electrical insulator and is more flame-resistant than fiberglass-only boards.
         470. What does "FR4" mean?
         1. FR-4 is a NEMA grade designation for glass-reinforced epoxy laminate material. FR-4 is a composite material composed of woven fiberglass cloth with an epoxy resin binder that is flame resistant
         471. Why are PCBs often green? What other colors could they be?
         1.  It is due to the solder mask, which protects the copper circuits printed on the fibre glass core to prevent short circuits, soldering errors, etc. The colour of the solder mask gives the board its appearance.
         472. What is the layer with text called?
         1. It's called a layout. Or a PCB layout. Or a PCB design. Specifically, it's a copper layer from a design.
         473. What is a solder mask?
         1. Solder mask, solder stop mask or solder resist is a thin lacquer-like layer of polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of a printed circuit board for protection against oxidation and to prevent solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads.
Stackup
         474. What are the layers of a PCB? what are they made of?
         1. Substrate Layer. The substrate layer of any PCB is usually made from fiberglass, which gives the board its rigid form.

         3. Soldermask layer 
         4. Silkscreen layer
         475. How to choose how many layers for PCB?
         1. The number of PCB layers also depends on pin density and signal layers. As indicated by below chart, a pin density of 1.0 will necessitate 2 signal layers, and the number of necessary layers goes up as the pin density drops. With a pin density of 0.2 or less, you will need PCBs with at least 10 layers.
         476. How to choose board stackup?
         1. Number of Layers.
         2. the number and types of plans used (power plans and ground plans);
         3. sorting and sequence of levels;
         4. spacing between levels.
         477. What should be routed on each layer? What should be routed on inner layers vs top/bottom layer?
         1. The number of layers used for a PCB depends on the application, the operating frequencies, pin density, and the requirement for signal layers. With a two-layer stack-up, the top layer—or layer 1—works as a signal layer. A four-layer stack-up uses the top and bottom layers—or layers 1 and 4—as the signal layers.
         478. Which layer(s) should be the ground layer(s)?
         1. Both inner layers are the core, usually used as power or ground planes, while the top and bottom outer layers are for placing components and routing signals.
         479. Which layers should high-speed signals be routed?
         480. Which layers should power planes be on?
         481. What components would require a higher layer count?
Design/Layout/Routing
         482. What are some general rule of thumbs for board routing?
         1. Here are some of those routing rules of thumb: Give yourself enough room for routing large data memory buses. Remember to allow for escape routing as well. Place parts so that sensitive digital signals do not get routed through analog circuitry or analog signals through digital circuitry.
         483. How do you decide which subsystems go where on a PCB?
Grounding
         484. What is grounding on a PCB? Why is it so important?
         1. The ground plane on a printed circuit board is typically a large area of metal connected to the circuit ground. This area of metal is sometimes only a small portion of the board, or in a multi-layer design it may be one entire board layer. Depending on the needs of the design, it may even occupy multiple layers
         485. Describe some basic grounding layout techniques.
         1. Ensure Everything Is Attached.
         2. Keep Your Ground Layer Whole. 
         3. Have a Common Ground Point.
         4. Minimize the Use of Series Vias.
         5. Design Grounding Before Routing.
         6. Understand How Your Currents Are Flowing.
         7. Prepare for Dynamic Variance Between Grounds.
         8. Keep Mixed-Signal Considerations in Mind.
         486. What is a ground plane? Pros/cons?
         1. The ground plane on a printed circuit board is a conducting body that acts as an arbitrary node of potential voltage and a common return for electric current. It is a point of zero reference or zero volts. The ground is the reference against which you base the signal.
         487. What is ground stitching?
         1. Ground Planes via stitching are done to ensure shorter ground return paths in PCB from the load devices to the power source. Thus, it maintains a healthy ground return path obtaining low resistance in the ground plane.
         488. What are the tradeoffs between using a ground plane vs ground traces to connect all ground potentials?
         489. In addition to providing a common reference potential, what are some other functionalities of ground planes?
         1. Because its principal purpose is to allow the flow of return current (Fig. 2.21), there should be a minimum of interruptions to it, and for this reason ground planes are more successful on a multilayer board where an entire layer can be devoted, one to the power plane and one to the ground.
         2. Ground plane shielding is essential to preventing crosstalk and other noise problems in high-speed circuit boards that require good signal integrity for their operation.
         490. Why can you use your ground plane to shield your signals?
         1. A ground plane will provide that easy return path. Ground planes will help to shield your sensitive circuits from the effects of external electromagnetic interference (EMI), as well as keeping internally created EMI from affecting other devices.
         491. Which layers typically have ground planes and why?
         1. 4-layer PCBs are printed circuit boards that have four conductive layers: the top layer, two inner layers, and the bottom layer. Both inner layers are the core, usually used as power or ground planes, while the top and bottom outer layers are for placing components and routing signals
         492. Why are ground probe points important?
         493. When/why should you separate your ground reference potentials?
         494. What are some ground layout schemes?
         495. What is star grounding?
         1. A star ground is a single point that connects analog and digital ground planes or traces. A star ground is not literally in the shape of a star, but the idea is that each connection is made at a single central point.
         496. What are the tradeoffs between combining analog, digital, and power grounds vs separating them?
         497. What happens if your ground plane potential differs throughout your board?
         498. What can be the source of ground plan potential variation?
         499. How do you avoid too much variation?
         500. How can you design your system to be more resilient against ground disturbances?
         1. Minimize return paths. The shorter the return paths, the lower the inductance between components and the ground plane.
         2. Use short component leads.
         3. Use multiple vias.
         4. Offset switching, if possible.
         5. Use slower switching components, if possible.
Decoupling/Bypass Capacitors
         501. What are decoupling capacitors? When are they needed?
         1. A decoupling capacitor is a capacitor used to decouple one part of an electrical network from another. Noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor, reducing its effect on the rest of the circuit.
         502. What are some common values for decoupling capacitors?
         1. Local decoupling capacitors typically have nominal values of 0.001, 0.01 or 0.047 microfarads. Some active devices may require several local decoupling capacitors in order to respond to a sudden demand for current.
         503. What are some rules of thumb when placing and routing decoupling capacitors?
         1. The golden rule of decoupling capacitor placement is to minimize the distance between the component's voltage pin and the capacitor. This means you'll need to place the decoupling capacitor as close as possible to the IC's pin.
         504. Why do decoupling capacitors need to be placed as close to the source package as possible?
         1. Decoupling capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the source for the signal being decoupled. This means at the pin for ICs and near the connector for input and out signals. To remove LF transients from input and output signals, the capacitor should be placed in series with the trace. It protects these sensitive chips by filtering out any excessive noise.
         505. What signals do you often want to decouple? Why?
         506. Often times you may see many decoupling capacitors on a signal. Why are there so many? If they're in parallel, why not just place one massive capacitor?
         1. A lot of the capacitors you see in circuits, especially those featuring an integrated circuit, are decoupling. A decoupling capacitor's job is to supress high-frequency noise in power supply signals. They take tiny voltage ripples, which could otherwise be harmful to delicate ICs, out of the voltage supply.
         507. If you have multiple decoupling capacitors, how do you lay them out and route them?
         508. What happens if the decoupling capacitors are placed too far from the package?
         509. How does parasitic inductance impact decoupling capacitor performance?
         510. What are some sources of parasitic inductance that may decrease the effectiveness of a decoupling capacitor?
         1. Parasitic or stray capacitance arises due to a number of factors: Most capacitors are made in the form of coils of metal foil and dielectric film. Any construction using coil will invariably cause an inductance between terminals.
         511. How can the packaging impact the effectiveness?
         512. What is a capacitor's self resonant frequency? Why is this important?
         1. The self resonant frequency of the capacitor is the frequency at which the capacitance of the capacitor and the inductance of the leads and package form a series resonant circuit. 
         513. When should you not use decoupling capacitors?
         1. Decoupling capacitors alone may not suffice in such cases as a high-power amplifier stage with a low-level pre-amplifier coupled to it. Care must be taken in layout of circuit conductors so that heavy current at one stage does not produce power supply voltage drops that affect other stages.
High-Speed Signals
Diff pairs and high-speed design from board layout/design perspective, as opposed to signals or SI perspective. Diff pairs are often used for high-speed signals, so there will be a good amount of overlap with the Transmission Lines (TL) section, especially microstrip TLs.
         514. What are some rules of thumb when routing high-speed signals?
         1. Route high-speed signals over a solid ground plane
         2. Avoid hot spots by placing vias in a grid.
         3. Keep trace bends at 135⁰ instead of 90⁰ avoid acute angles.
         4. Increase the spacing between traces to avoid crosstalk
         5. Avoid long stub traces by implementing daisy chain routing
         6. Do not place any components or vias between differential pairs
         7. Incorporate length matching to avoid skew between differential pairs
         8. Do not route signal over a split plane
         9. Separate analog and digital ground planes to reduce noise
         10. Split the layouts virtually between analog and digital grounds
         11. Keep trace width as per the size of discrete component
         515. Should you put vias through high-speed traces?
         1. Like signal traces, vias introduce inductance and capacitance to the circuit. In signals with lower frequencies, such characteristics are often negligible. However, placing vias on high-speed traces can alter the impedance and affect signal integrity. It's advisable to avoid using vias on high-speed signals.
         516. What shape should these high-speed traces be? Why?
         517. What is serpentining? Why is it important for synchronization?
Differential Pairs
         518. What is a differential pair? What are some tradeoffs?
         1. Differential signaling is a method for electrically transmitting information using two complementary signals. The technique sends the same electrical signal as a differential pair of signals, each in its own conductor. 
         519. How should it be routed? What are some layout guidelines that may differ from single-ended high-speed signals?
         520. Why is it important that signals for both lines of the diff pair arrive to the source at the same time? What happens if they don't arrive at the same time? How can you ensure that they do arrive at the same time?
         521. What is serpentining? Why is it important for diff pairs?
Transmission Line Effects
Transmission line (TL) effects on a PCB/microstrip transmission line, also lots of overlap with TL section.
         522. Describe transmission line components on a PCB.
         1. A PCB transmission line is a type of interconnection used for moving signals from the transmitters to the receivers on a circuit board. It is composed of two conductors: a signal trace and a return path which is usually a ground plane. The volume between the two conductors is made up of the dielectric material.
         523. What are some common characteristic impedance values?
         1. Characteristic impedance is determined by the geometry and materials of the transmission line and, for a uniform line, is not dependent on its length
         524. How can you change the characteristic impedance of a trace?
         1. The thinner the trace width, the more impedance is offered. Increasing the board thickness increases the impedance while reducing it will decrease the impedance. Lastly, increasing the copper weight will decrease the impedance while decreasing copper weight increases impedance.
         525. How does a trace's impedance change with respect to frequency?
         1. We see impedance starts increasing when frequency increases, and we also see it is the length of trace which determines the frequency when impedance starts increasing. These kinds of traces have relatively big inductance and low capacitance which leads to this impedance behavior.
         526. Describe some sources of reflection on a PCB (any any interfaces). How can these reflections be minimized?
         1. The first thing to remember is that signal reflection in PCB transmission lines occurs due to impedance discontinuity. A transmission line should have a uniform characteristic impedance. Any variation or discontinuities to the impedance causes signal reflection and distortion.
         527. How do any interfaces in the transmission path impact signal quality and reflections? What are some interfaces that may introduce distortion?
         528. I have a two-layer PCB built but when I get it, the manufacturer made a mistake and the substrate layer is twice as thick as it should be. How does this impact the characteristic impedance? What could I do to fix it?
Board-Level Termination
         529. If external termination components are used, where should they be placed? On the source, sink, or somewhere in between?
         530. How do you route external termination components?
         531. When would you need external termination components?
         532. Describe some termination networks.
         1. In electronics, electrical termination is the practice of ending a transmission line with a device that matches the characteristic impedance of the line.
         533. What is the difference between series and parallel termination?
         1. Parallel termination is arguably one of the most prevalent termination schemes today. In contrast to the series termination option, parallel termination employs a resistor across the differential lines at the far (receiver) end of the transmission line to eliminate all reflections.
High-Current Layout/Routing
         534. What are some rules of thumb when laying out and routing high-current connections?
         1. The first PCB layout rule of thumb—start with a complete plan. Map out your component placement for the best routing.
         535. What is a power plane/shapes? Why are they preferred over traces?
         1. Often designated as a VCC in PCB design, a power plane is simply a flat plane of copper connected to a power supply. Similar to how the ground plane is connected to the ground connection of the power supply. Its purpose is to provide a steady supply of voltage to your board.
         536. Are long shapes/traces preferred over short ones? Why?
         1. There are three important things to consider when routing high speed USB lines: trace width, trace spacing, and trace length. All are important but the most critical out of the three is making sure the two traces are matched as closely as possible in length.
         537. Are skinny shapes/traces preferred over thick ones? Why?
         1. The important characteristics to consider when selecting a trace width include: The current capacity of the trace (how much current will flow through it) The allowable spacing between traces. The size and pitch of the pads that the trace will be connecting to.
         538. What is a thermal relief pad?
         1. Thermal reliefs are the spoked connections from a thru-hole or surface mount pad to an area fill or plane. Their purpose is to provide a robust electrical connection from the pad to the plane while preventing the heat needed for soldering from dissipating into the metal plane.
         539. What is via stitching? When can it it be used?
         1. Via stitching is a technique used to tie together larger copper areas on different layers, in effect creating a strong vertical connection through the board structure, helping maintain a low impedance and short return loops.
         540. What can you do at the board-level to reduce heating of a component/IC?
         1. The easiest way to increase the efficiency of a component is to reduce the amount of heat dissipated in the first place.
         541. When should heat sinks be used?
         1.  A heat sink is a part with a large surface area consisting of thermally conductive metal. This heat sink is typically attached to printed circuit board components, including power transistors and switching devices. The purpose of this part is to absorb and dissipate heat. It should be used when performance is affected by overheating.
Power Supply Layout/Routing
Mostly dealing with switching power supplies as they present additional layout and routing challenges. Tons of overlap with the previous High-Current Layout/Routing as power supplies often need to supply lots of current.
Power Supply-Level Layout and Placement
         542. What are some considerations when deciding where to place the power supply?
         1. When placing your components, the first thing you should do is make sure they all have enough space. Usually, this means placing edge connectors first, as these may be dictated by the mechanical design. Next, watch out for high pin count components like BGAs.
         543. Why do you want to place your power supply close to the load?
         544. What happens if your load tries to draw too much current but there's lots of trace distance between your load and power supply?
         1. If your circuit attempts to draw too much power the power supply will give an error indication and prevent excessive current from flowing.
Component-Level Layout/Routing
         545. What are some considerations when laying out power supply components?
         1. Choosing the right regulator
         2. Thermal management
         3. Choosing the right capacitor
         4. Power integrity
         5. Frequency response
         546. What are some important nodes of consideration of switch mode power supplies? Why?
         547. What are the noisy nodes of a power supply? How should to route these noisy nodes and why? What are other board-level considerations of noisy nodes?
         548. How should you route the input capacitor?
         549. What if the input capacitor is placed too far?
         550. How should you route the switch node of a buck converter?
         1. Draw wire far away from switching node of inductor and diode. Do not wire directly below the inductor and diode, and not parallel to power supply line.
         551. How should you route the inductor of a buck converter?
         1. Avoid all traces and pours running under the inductor where possible to minimize induced noise/current
         552. How should you route the sense/feedback network of a buck converter?
         1. High current carrying traces must be thick and short. Keep feedback trace away from inductor and other noisy traces. 
         553. How do you route decoupling and bulk capacitors?
         1.  Place bulk decoupling capacitors near the entry point where a voltage enters into the board.
Sense Resistor Layout/Routing
         554. How do you route a current sense resistors?
         555. Why is it important that the traces be short?
         1. Just as with analog routing, you will want to keep your traces as short as possible to reduce the chance of these traces behaving like antennas and creating additional noise. It is also helpful to use 45° or rounded corners when possible instead of right angles.
         556. What if your sense resistor is far?
         557. What is a kelvin connection for a sense resistor? What are the tradeoffs?
         1. A Kelvin connection is a means of making precision electrical potential contact with a current carrying component or reference point in such a way that eliminates or greatly reduces the effect of contact resistance.
         2. What is a ' Kelvin' configuration? A 'Kelvin' configuration resistor features four leads or terminations. These four terminal resistors enable current to be applied through two opposite leads and a sensing voltage to be measured across the other two leads.
Noise, Interference, and Coupling
         558. Why is noise a consideration at the board-level?
         1.  In the electronic world, noise generally refers to an unwanted signal. In an electrical circuit, too much noise can disrupt the characteristics of the signal
         559. What is electromagnetic interference (EMI)?
         1. An electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or otherwise degrades or limits the effective performance of electronics/electrical equipment.
         560. What are some sources of EMI on a PCB?
         1. EMI constitutes both common and differential mode radiations.
         2. Conducted interference can be reduced using a ferrite core/ferrite ring. 
         3. Poor decoupling practices result in unintentional common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) currents.
         561. Why do I want to avoid radiated EMI?
         562. What are some board-level techniques to minimize radiated EMI?
         1. Avoid sharp right-angle bends.
         2. Keep your signals separate. 
         3. Keep return paths short.
         4. Route differential traces as close as possible.
         5. Use vias wisely.
         563. What about external sources of EMI? How can they impact a circuit?
         1. Television transmissions both analog and digital.
         2. Radio AM, FM, and Satellite.
         3. Solar Magnetic Storms which peak on a eleven year cycle.
         4. Lightning which occurs as a very high voltage and high current event.
         5. Utility power grid transmission lines which have high voltage, low current, and low frequency characteristics.
         564. What are some board-level techniques to protect against EMI?
         1. Common techniques to minimize EMI are line filtering, power-supply design, proper layout, and shielding the enclosure.
         565. How can signals couple together? How can this be prevented?
         1.  When PCB traces are in close proximity, they can talk to each other through the capacitor created by these traces.
         566. What are some board-level techniques to minimize coupling?
         1. Minimum width among traces.
         2. Keep traces on adjacent layers perpendicular.
         3. Use ground planes.
         4. Exploit ground return path.
         5. Use differential signals.
         6. Reduce the width of parallel traces.
         7. Isolate high frequency signals from other traces.
         8. Isolate asynchronous signals.
         567. If I have two traces on adjacent layers, one a clock and another a sensitive analog signal. How should I route these signals?
         568. What is desense? Why should it be avoided? What are some board-level techniques to avoid it?
         1. Desense is the degradation in sensitivity due to noise sources, typically which are generated by the same device the radio is in.
EMI Shields
         569. What are EMI shields? Why/when are they needed?
         1. EMI Shielding in electronic devices and equipment is the use of manufacturing techniques and materials to protect signals from being disrupted by external electromagnetic signals as well as preventing generated signals from interfering with surrounding components.
         570. How do EMI shields work?
         1. As signals reach your device, the screen absorbs them, causing a current within its body. A ground connection or a virtual ground plane then absorb this current. The EMI shield absorbs transmitted signals before they reach any sensitive circuits on your device, and it keeps your protected signal clean.
         571. What are EMI shields typically connected to? Why?
         1. You can find EMI shielding anywhere you find sensitive electronic equipment requiring isolation from outside electromagnetic fields. So in the medical industry, this means EMI shielding goes on equipment like AM/FM emergency service transmission and other communication devices
         572. Where should I place EMI shields?
         573. What is a faraday cage?
         1. A Faraday cage or Faraday shield is an enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields. A Faraday shield may be formed by a continuous covering of conductive material, or in the case of a Faraday cage, by a mesh of such materials. 
Vias
         574. What is a via? Why are they needed?
         1. A via is an electrical connection between copper layers in a printed circuit board. Essentially a via is a small drilled hole that goes through two or more adjacent layers; the hole is plated with copper that forms electrical connection through the insulation that separates the copper layers.
         575. If I have a signal on two separate layers, how can I connect them together?
         576. What are the different types of vias? What are their tradeoffs?
         1. Blind vias: connect an exterior layer to an interior layer.
         2. Buried vias: connect two interior layers.
         3. Through vias: connect two exterior layers.
         577. If I need to via between inner layers, what type of vias would I use?
         1. Buried vias are used to connect the circuit between two or more inner layers. Unlike the blind via, if a buried via connects 3+ inner layers, it can't be directly drilled on the PCB.
         578. When would I want filled vias?
         1. Via hole sizes less than 0.3mm have the best chance of getting filled, while between 0.3mm to 0.5mm sizes, filling results may vary. Because this is an uncontrolled process, it is not recommended when holes need to be closed.
         579. When would I want plugged vias?
         1. Via plugging is done as a preventive measure to secure the vias from the unwanted flow of solder material during the assembly/soldering process. During the soldering process, if a via is not plugged or tented, the solder can flow down the via from the pads and can create unnecessary solder joints.
         580. What are some common failure modes of vias?
         581. When do I not want to use vias?
         582. Can you put a via on a surface-mount pad?
         1. Don't place vias on the pads. The solder will suck into the via and create a faulty soldering. The solder joint will not have enough solder to be reliable.
         583. What happens if you have too many vias?
         1. In RF or high frequency SMPS you may want to shape current path hence you may not want to put too many vias, also sometimes too many vias makes soldering very hard and reduces overall system reliability. There is no case where adding another plane-stitching via will make things worse from an RF perspective.
         584. What happens if you have too many vias through a power plane?
         1. Too many vias makes soldering very hard and reduces overall system reliability.
         585. What is "swiss cheesing" a plane?

         5. Solder Flux Corrosion.
         6. Broken Solder Joints.
         7. Electro Static Discharge.
         590. How do you test ICs at the board-level?
         591. How do you test components at the board level?
         1. If the components look fine, you'll need to power up the circuit board. Measure the voltage of the power rails with the multimeter. Both the input and output of the voltage regulator need to show the expected values. Check the fuse if the input voltage measured at the voltage regulator is 0V.
         592. Given a PCB with x, how would you test it?
PCB Fabrication
         593. Describe the PCB fabrication process. How are PCBs made?
         1. To produce a multi-layer PCB, alternating layers of epoxy-infused fiberglass sheet called prepreg and conductive core materials are laminated together under high temperature and pressure using a hydraulic press. The pressure and heat causes the prepreg to melt and join the layers together.
         594. What is panelization?
         1. PCB panelization is a manufacturing technique in which smaller boards are manufactured en-masse connected together as a single array, making it easier to move through an assembly line. The individual boards can easily be depanelized or removed from the array for packaging or installation into a product.
         595. What are mousebites?
         1. Mouse bites in PCBs refer to little perforations on boards. In addition, mouse bites look like half holes on a postage stamp. So, these perforations allow small boards to connect in a group. You can also call the holes perforated PCB breakaway tabs.
         596. What are fiducials?
         1. Fiducials are round pad markers that are placed on the PCB during the design process and are used during surface-mount assembly to aid stencil positioning and to ensure that the pick and place machine is using consistent reference points while positioning parts.
Manufacturing and Assembly
         597. Describe the PCB manufacturing and assembly process.
         1. The various stages in the PCB assembly process including adding solder paste to the board, pick and place of the components, soldering, inspection and test. All these processes are required, and need to be monitored to ensure that product of the highest quality is produced.
         598. What is the difference between surface-mount and through-hole components? Any tradeoffs?
         1. While surface-mount devices (SMDs) are secured only by solder on the surface of the board, through-hole component leads run through the board, allowing the components to withstand more environmental stress.
         599. How are components soldered on a PCB?
         1. A soldering iron first transfers heat to a PCB board.From there, the solder is applied to connect the two metals. A soldering iron in the shape of a pen is usually the easiest to use, however, all soldering irons take a certain amount of practice and skill to use effectively.
         600. How are double-sided components soldered on a PCB? What are some techniques?
         1. In the double-sided PCB soldering process, components are placed and soldered on each side of the board individually. The trick here is to solder at just the right temperature and time as the components on the first side will be going through reflow soldering twice.
         601. What about mixed assembly boards?
         600. What is pick-and-place?
         1. A pick and place (PNP) machine is a robotic assembly device that uses a vacuum to lift a component off of a piece of tape, rotate it to the right orientation, then place it on a circuit board. It takes a few hours to setup a machine to build the assembly, but once everything is running, it is very fast.
         601. Pick-and-place machines must often traverse repetitive paths for assembly. What are some optimizations?
         602. What is reflow?
         1. Reflow soldering is the most widely used method of attaching surface mount components to printed circuit boards (PCBs). The aim of the process is to form acceptable solder joints by first pre-heating the components/PCB/solder paste and then melting the solder without causing damage by overheating.
         603. What is wave soldering?
         1. Wave soldering is a large-scale soldering process by which electronic components are soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB) to form an electronic assembly. The name is derived from the use of waves of molten solder to attach metal components to the PCB.
Automated Testing
         604. How are PCBs tested? When does this happen?
         605. How are PCBs testing at a large scale?
         1. Automated optical inspection (AOI) is suitable for large-scale production. An AOI machine compares the photo of the tested circuit board taken by a single 2D camera or two 3D cameras to the given example. This equipment may be placed at the end of the production line for timely flaw detection
         606. What sort of tests do PCBs undergo on the assembly line? What are the steps?
         607. What are a few test stations you would see on an electronics manufacturing/assembly line?
         608. What is automated optical inspection (AOI)? What can it capture?
         1. Automated optical inspection (AOI) is an automated visual inspection of printed circuit board (PCB) (or LCD, transistor) manufacture where a camera autonomously scans the device under test for both catastrophic failure (e.g. missing component) and quality defects (e.g. fillet size or shape or component skew).
         609. What is in-circuit testing (ICT)? What can it capture?
         1. ICT (In-circuit testing) is a method of white box testing for PCBs. It checks shorts, opens and other basic components of the board like resistance and capacitance. ICT may be performed with electronic test fixture (bed of nails), or with a fixtureless in-circuit test setup.
         610. What is functional testing (FCT)? What can it capture?
         1. Functional test (FCT) is used as a final manufacturing step. It provides a pass/fail determination on finished PCBs before they are shipped.
         611. What is flying probe testing? What can it capture?
         1. A simple way of explaining, the Flying Probe Test (FPT) is an automated system with a small number of probes that "flies" around the top and bottom of a PCB simultaneously to make contact with the test points.
         612. What are bed-of-nails test fixtures? What can they capture?
         1. A bed of nails tester is a traditional electronic test fixture. It has numerous pins inserted into holes, which are aligned using tooling pins to make contact with test points on a printed circuit board and are also connected to a measuring unit by wires.

         2. Creating the schematic.
         3. Use a schematic capture tool to create your PCB layout.
         4. Design your PCB stackup.
         5. Define design rules and requirements.
         6. Place your components.
         7. Insert drill holes.
         8. Route the traces.
         9. Add Labels and Identifiers
         10. Generate design / layout files
         614. How can you ensure testability of your design at high volumes in automated testing environments?
         615. What is component tombstoning? When can it happen? How can it be prevented?
         1.  Tombstoning also known as the Manhattan or crocodile effect is where one end of the component lifts from a pad of the PCB during reflow soldering process and affects mainly surface mount components such as resistors, capacitor and inductors.
Design for Testing (DFT)
         616. How can you design a PCB for testing?
         1. In-circuit test points should be distributed across the board without being concentrated in any one area. 
         617. What special board design choices would you do for PCB prototyping?
         618. What are ground probes on a PCB? Why are they needed? When should they be used?
Test Points
         619. What are test points? What are their use cases?
         1. A PCB test point is a small wire loop used for test probes on a PCB that contains surface-mount parts. During production, they enable the user to inject test signals or monitor the board's circuitry. Test points come in a variety of materials, sizes and colors.
         620. What are different types of test points?
         621. What are layout guidelines for test points?
         1. The general requirements for adding test points to a PCB layout are simple: test points are ideally added to the non-component side of a PCB. However, if the side selected for test points includes components, avoid placement near parts taller than .200 in [5.08mm]
         622. When should/shouldn't you use them?
         623. Should you use test points on high-speed or sensitive signals? Why?
         624. Who/what uses test points?
         1. A PCB test point is a small wire loop used for test probes on a PCB that contains surface-mount parts. 
         625. If you're short on board space, how do you prioritize which signals should have test points?
         1. Prioritize them in the same way you would approach a board test. For example, you'd likely want to check power rails and voltage references are within spec 
Debugging and Making Measurements on PCBs
         626. If there's a short on the PCB, how can it be detected, found, and root caused?
         1. A short circuit may result in some components getting burnt. A cracked IC, blown capacitor, or the familiar acrid smell of burnt components are all telltale signs that a short circuit is close by. Locate and remove the damaged component and investigate traces connected to it.
         627. How do you measure signals on a PCB? What are some considerations?
         1. Crosstalk waveforms, and to identify strong coupling regions.
         2. Reflection waveforms.
         3. Other signal behavior metrics (rise/fall time, overshoot/undershoot, etc.)
         4. Calculate average impedance along the length of the track.
         628. How can test points be used to measure signals?
         629. When measuring a signal, what is the ground loop?
         1. A ground loop is the flow of current from one signal ground to another because of a voltage differential between the two grounds. This can happen if two devices in the network are grounded at separate locations and one of the locations causes the signal ground there to experience a higher voltage potential.
         630. Why should your ground loop be as small as possible?
         1. The larger the loop, the more interference. If you are using the building's steel frame for your ground, then the loop can be as large as the whole building. The resistance in the ground wires turns the interference currents into voltage fluctuations in the ground system.
         631. How can you reduce your ground loop?
         1. To avoid or eliminate ground loops, when they are detected, requires severing the loop. Suggestions for severing ground loops include: Connect the shield wire of a signal cable to ground only at one end of the cable. Leave the other end floating (not connected to ground).
Reworking PCBs
         632. What is PCB rework?
         1. Rework is the term for the refinishing operation or repair of an electronic printed circuit board assembly, usually involving desoldering and re-soldering of surface-mounted electronic components.
         633. Describe any rework experience you have.
         634. What sort of rework can be done on a PCB?
         1. Rework of the PCB assembly involves de-soldering or re-soldering on the board of some surface-mounted and throughhole components
         635. Why may rework be needed?
         1. Aside from physical damage, component failure is the most common reason why PCBs need repair and rework. Component failure may be the result of low quality, dislodging, or ageing of components. A bad PCB layout, however, is the most common cause
         636. What can you do in your design to improve reworkability?
         637. Often times many power components or ground components have thermal relief pads. How does this impact reworkability?
Electrical Computer-Aided Design (ECAD) Software
         638. Do you have experience with Eagle/Altium/KiKad/Cadence Allegro?
         639. What experience do you have with ECAD software?
         640. Do you have any scripting experience in ECAD?
         641. What are design rule checks (DRC)?
         1. Design Rule Checking (DRC) verifies as to whether a specific design meets the constraints imposed by the process technology to be used for its manufacturing. DRC checking is an essential part of the physical design flow and ensures the design meets manufacturing requirements and will not result in a chip failure.

         643. What are the tradeoffs between surface-mount and through-hole packaging?
         1. The pin count is higher in SMT than in through-hole technology. Because components are more compact, the packing density achieved through SMT is much higher than in through-hole mounting. SMT components are typically less expensive than their through-hole counterparts.
         644. What are ball grid array (BGA) packages? What are their tradeoffs?
         1. A ball grid array (BGA) is a type of surface-mount packaging (a chip carrier) used for integrated circuits. BGA packages are used to permanently mount devices such as microprocessors. A BGA can provide more interconnection pins than can be put on a dual in-line or flat package.
         645. What is the difference between the die, wafer, and package?
         1. Typically, integrated circuits are produced in large batches on a single wafer of electronic-grade silicon (EGS) or other semiconductor (such as GaAs) through processes such as photolithography. The wafer is cut (diced) into many pieces, each containing one copy of the circuit. Each of these pieces is called a die.
         646. What are node sizes? What does "3nm process" refer to? Are transistors really that small?
         647. What are package on package (PoP) chips? What are their tradeoffs?

         648. How do PoP chips impact thermals?
         649. Which chips are often PoP? Why?
         650. Describe any yield considerations when fabricating chips.
         651. Why can't ginormous chips, single die be made? What are some challenges and workarounds?
         652. What are chiplets?
         1. A chiplet is a tiny integrated circuit that contains a well-defined subset of functionality. It is designed to be combined with other chiplets on an interposer in a single package. A set of chiplets can be implemented in a mix-and-match "LEGO-like" assembly.
         653. What are 3D chips?
         1. A three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) is a MOS (metal-oxide semiconductor) integrated circuit(IC) manufactured by stacking silicon wafers or dies and interconnecting them vertically using, for instance, through-silicon vias (TSVs) or Cu-Cu connections, so that they behave as a single device to achieve performance improvements at reduced power and smaller footprint than conventional two dimensional processes. The 3D IC is one of several 3D integration schemes that exploit the z-direction to achieve electrical performance benefits in microelectronics and nanoelectronics.
         654. What are bond wires?
         1.  Wire bonding is a method of bonding thin metal wires to a pad, as a technology that connects the internal chip and the outside. In terms of structure, wires act as a bridge between the bonding pad of the chip (first bond) and the pad of the carrier (second bond)
         655. Bond wires are often very thin but sometimes may need to carry lots of current. How do you reconcile this?
         656. What are flip chips?
         1. Flip chip, also known as controlled collapse chip connection or its abbreviation, C4, is a method for interconnecting dies such as semiconductor devices, IC chips, integrated passive devices and microelectromechanical systems, to external circuitry with solder bumps that have been deposited onto the chip pads.
         657. Why would the ground potential of a chip vary?
IC Fabrication
         658. How are ICs made?
         1. In the manufacturing process of IC, electronic circuits with components such as transistors are formed on the surface of a silicon crystal wafer. A thin film layer that will form the wiring, transistors and other components is deposited on the wafer (deposition). The thin film is coated with photoresist.
         659. What is a wafer?
         1. In electronics, a wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as a crystalline silicon, used for the fabrication of integrated circuits and, in photovoltaics, to manufacture solar cells. The wafer serves as the substrate for microelectronic devices built in and upon the wafer.
         660. What is the process from wafer to chip?
         1. Lithography, or photolithography, is the critical step in the computer chip-making process. It involves coating the wafer with photosensitive material and exposing it with light inside an ASML lithography machine.
         661. What is photolithography?
         1. Photolithography is a subclass of microlithography, the general term for processes that generate patterned thin films.
         662. What is etching?
         1. PCB etching is the process of removing copper from a circuit board layer that is not protected by the hardened photoresist by immersing it in a chemical solution. The etching used by industrial circuit board fabricators is broken into two different processes: acidic etching and alkaline.
         663. What is atomic layer deposition?
         1. Atomic layer deposition is a thin-film deposition technique based on the sequential use of a gas-phase chemical process; it is a subclass of chemical vapor deposition. The majority of ALD reactions use two chemicals called precursors.
         664. Some feature sizes may be in the nm range, but the wavelengths of light used may not be in that same range. How are these small feature sizes created?

Signals
         665. What is the difference between an analog signal and a digital signal?
         1.  The major difference between both signals is that the analog signals have continuous electrical signals, while digital signals have non-continuous electrical signals.
         666. What is the Fourier Transform?
         1. A Fourier transform is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions into frequency components, which are represented by the output of the transform as a function of frequency.
         667. What is the difference between the Fourier Transform and Fourier Series?
         1. The difference between the Fourier transform and the Fourier series is that the Fourier transform is applicable for non-periodic signals, while the Fourier series is applicable to periodic signals.
         668. If I want to measure a sine wave, what should be the sample rate?
         1. The Nyquist theorem is also known as the sampling theorem. It is the principle to accurately reproduce a pure sine wave measurement, or sample, rate, which must be at least twice its frequency.
         669. What is the nyquist rate of a signal? Why is it important?
         1. In signal processing, the Nyquist rate, named after Harry Nyquist, is a value (in units of samples per second or hertz, Hz) equal to twice the highest frequency (bandwidth) of a given function or signal.
         670. What is aliasing?
         1. Aliasing occurs when an oscilloscope does not sample the signal fast enough to construct an accurate waveform record. The signal frequency is misidentified, and the waveforms displayed on an oscilloscope become indistinguishable. Aliasing is basically a form of undersampling.
Square Waves
         671. What is a square wave? What are its properties?
         1. A square wave is a non-sinusoidal periodic waveform in which the amplitude alternates at a steady frequency between fixed minimum and maximum values, with the same duration at minimum and maximum. In an ideal square wave, the transitions between minimum and maximum are instantaneous.
         672. What is PWM? What are its characteristics?
         1. Pulse-width modulation, or pulse-duration modulation, is a method of reducing the average power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts. The average value of voltage fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate.
         673. Draw spectral content of square wave/pulse train.
         674. Why are square waves so noisy? What can you do to decrease noise? What about decreasing noise at a particular frequnecy content?
         1. Because it contains a sudden jump (a discontinuity), there are lot of high frequency harmonics in the sound spectrum, resulting in a harsh, buzzy tone. One way to mitigate this is to synthesize a band-limited square wave, by adding fewer harmonics to approximate the wave.
         675. What is the highest frequency component of a real vs ideal square wave?
         676. What is the rule of thumb for the highest frequency content of a real square wave?
         677. What are the tradeoffs of sharper edges on a square wave?
         678. How does the frequency content of sharp vs not sharp square waves?
Differential Signaling
Diff pairs from signals perspective, as opposed to board layout/design or SI perspective.
         679. What is a differential pair? How does it work?
         1. In differential signaling, each signal is transmitted using a differential pair—the signal carried by one wire is the same level as the one carried by the other wire, but in opposite polarity. The signal at the receiving end is interpreted as the difference between the two lines that make up the differential pair.
         680. What is the difference between a single-ended and differential signal?
         1. Single ended is the most cost-efficient option to implement because fewer wires are required for transmitting multiple signals. However, single- ended signaling can create “noise” by design. Differential signaling transmits electrical signals using two complementary signals, each in its own conductor
         681. When are they often used?
         1. Differential signaling is used in many communication schemes including HDMI, USB, DVI, CAN, LVDS, and more. Differential signaling uses two wires and therefore two signals accomplish transmitting a series of bits from one point to another.
         682. How do they improve noise immunity?
         1. If the voltage noise on one wire is uncorrelated to the noise on the other one, it takes twice as much noise to cause an error with the differential system as with the single-ended system. In other words, differential signalling doubles the noise immunity.
         683. What does the common-mode voltage refer to?
         1. Common-mode signal is the voltage common to both input terminals of an electrical device. In telecommunication, the common-mode signal on a transmission line is also known as longitudinal voltage. In most electrical circuits the signal is transferred by a differential voltage between two conductors.
         684. What does the differential voltage refer to?
         1. Differential Output Voltage (VOD)—The difference in voltage between the positive and complementary conductors of a differential transmission. You can think of this value as the difference of the two conductors.

Signal Integrity/Power Integrity (SI/PI)
         685. What is SI/PI? Why is it important?
         1. Companies designing complex PCBs are faced with power integrity (PI) and signal integrity (SI) issues driven by increasing data transmission rates combined with decreases in power-supply voltages and denser, smaller geometries. Increased functionality and smaller product geometries are making PCBs more complex.
         686. Do you have any SI/PI simulation experience?
Signal Integrity (SI)
         687. How to characterize the quality of a signal?
         1. Most people usually look to Signal to Noise Ratio to measure the signal quality of either audio or video communications. Signal to noise ratio is usually written either S/N or SNR. Most of the time the signal to noise ratio is measured in decibels. A decibel is a measure of power or loudness.
         688. What is ground bounce?
         1. In electronic engineering, ground bounce is a phenomenon associated with transistor switching where the gate voltage can appear to be less than the local ground potential, causing the unstable operation of a logic gate.
         689. What happens if signal rising edge is too slow? Too fast?
         690. What is signal monotonicity?
         1. It means that the input/output transfer function of a converter (or other component, or of the overall channel) may be imperfect, but the curve never reverses direction. A monolithic converter is one where the output increases with increases in input, and never decreases (and vice versa).
         691. Why is monotonicity during a signal transition important?
         692. What is hysteresis and why is it used?
         1. Hysteresis occurs in a system that involves a magnetic field. Hysteresis is the common property of ferromagnetic substances. Generally, when the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials lags behind the magnetic field this effect can be described as the hysteresis effect.
         693. What are setup and hold times? What happens if they're violated?
         1. Setup time is the amount of time required for the input to a Flip-Flop to be stable before a clock edge. Hold time is similar to setup time, but it deals with events after a clock edge occurs. Hold time is the minimum amount of time required for the input to a Flip-Flop to be stable after a clock edge
         694. What is crosstalk?
         1. In electronics, crosstalk is any phenomenon by which a signal transmitted on one circuit or channel of a transmission system creates an undesired effect in another circuit or channel. Crosstalk is usually caused by undesired capacitive, inductive, or conductive coupling from one circuit or channel to another.
         695. What is jitter?
         1. In electronics and telecommunications, jitter is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a reference clock signal. In clock recovery applications it is called timing jitter.
         696. What is ringing?
         1. In electronics, signal processing, and video, ringing is oscillation of a signal, particularly in the step response (the response to a sudden change in input). Often ringing is undesirable, but not always, as in the case of resonant inductive coupling. It is also known as hunting.
Differential Pairs (SI Perspective)
Diff pairs from SI perspective, as opposed to board layout/design or signals perspective.
         697. How do you characterize SI of a differential pair?
         698. What is an eye digram? What does it represent?
         1. Simply put, an eye diagram is a data dependent electrical measurement used to evaluate high speed data quality. An eye diagram is measured in the time domain. And as with most time domain electrical measurements, variation in the measurement will occur in every set of samples
         699. What happens of the eye diagram is too small? What is often used to represent this?
         700. What is the mask of an eye diagram? What happens if some of the signal enters the mask?
         1. The data eye mask represents the “keep-out” region. Signals at the receiver must not cross the data eye mask region, or a violation of receiver timing requirements occurs. The mask is defined based on receiver properties and can have various shapes (rectangular, triangular, etc.).
         701. What can you do expand the eye?
         702. What can you do to ensure the eye stays out of the mask?
         703. How is timing jitter and amplitude noise illustrated on an eye diagram?
Power Integrity (PI)
Lots of crossover with Power Electronics section.
         704. How do you characterize the quality of power supply?
         1.  Good power quality can be defined as a steady supply voltage that stays within the prescribed range, steady AC frequency close to the rated value, and smooth voltage curve waveform (which resembles a sine wave). I
         705. What is a power supply ripple? Where does it come from?
         1. Ripple (specifically ripple voltage) in electronics is the residual periodic variation of the DC voltage within a power supply which has been derived from an alternating current (AC) source. This ripple is due to incomplete suppression of the alternating waveform after rectification.
         706. What is power sequencing? Why is it important?
         1. Power sequencing is an essential part of any design, especially in complex systems that utilize multiple power rails. High-performance processing devices such as FPGAs, ASICs, PLDs, DSPs and microcontrollers, require multiple voltage rails to power internal circuitry, such as the core, memory and I/O.
         707. What are power supply spikes? Would could be their cause and how can they be captured?
         1. Spikes and transients are fast-moving, high-energy bursts lasting for just a few milliseconds that are superimposed onto the normal mains power supply. They range from a few volts to several thousand volts (some can be 6 kV or higher) and are caused by the sudden release of stored energy.

Transmission Lines
More on generic transmission line (TL) and high-speed design theory, as opposed to its implementation/analysis in the context of PCB design which is in its own section: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) > Design/Layout/Routing > High-Speed Signals
TL Theory
         708. What is TL theory? Why is it needed?
         1. Transmission line theory explains the results in terms of a forward and a reflected wave, the two components summing at each end to satisfy the boundary conditions: zero current for an open circuit, zero voltage for a short.
         709. When is TL analysis valid?
         710. What is characteristic impedance?
         1. The characteristic impedance or surge impedance of a uniform transmission line is the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current of a single wave propagating along the line; that is, a wave traveling in one direction in the absence of reflections in the other direction.
         711. What are reflections? Why do I care about them?
         1. In telecommunications, signal reflection occurs when a signal is transmitted along a transmission medium, such as a copper cable or an optical fiber. Some of the signal power may be reflected back to its origin rather than being carried all the way along the cable to the far end. This happens because imperfections in the cable cause impedance mismatches and non-linear changes in the cable characteristics. These abrupt changes in characteristics cause some of the transmitted signal to be reflected. 
         712. Draw some signals with/without reflections.
         713. What causes reflections?
         714. What is impedance matching? Why do I care about it and when should it be used?
         1. In electronics, impedance matching is the practice of designing or adjusting the input impedance or output impedance of an electrical device for a desired value. Often, the desired value is selected to maximize power transfer or minimize signal reflection.
         715. How does R, L, and C impact characteristic impedance? How does that differ on a microstrip vs coax TL?
         1.  Characteristic impedance is purely a function of the capacitance and inductance distributed along the line’s length and would exist even if the dielectric were perfect (infinite parallel resistance) and the wires superconducting (zero series resistance).
         716. What is the difference and tradeoffs of series vs parallel termination?
         1. Unlike series termination where high data rates and long cable lengths can negatively impact data integrity, parallel termination can effectively remove all reflections; thereby removing all concerns about reflections interfering with data transitions.
         717. What is the difference and tradeoffs of source vs sink termination/matching?
Ideal vs Real TLs
         718. Draw real TL distributed model. What are its components on a real TL? How do they differ between ideal vs real?
         719. How can I control the characteristic impedance of a TL?
         720. What are some standard termination/characteristic impedances?
         721. Describe the parasitic R, L, and C components that impact characteristic impedance.
         722. What are sources of loss and distortion in a TL? How can they be minimized or actively compensated for?
         1. The separation and attenuation of different frequencies by a transmission line causes distortion of the signals it carries. The longer the transmission line, the greater the distortion. The higher the frequency of the input, the greater the distortion.
         723. What are dielectric losses? Where do they come from and how does it vary with frequency?
         1. Dielectric loss quantifies a dielectric material's inherent dissipation of electromagnetic energy (e.g. heat).[1] It can be parameterized in terms of either the loss angle δ or the corresponding loss tangent tan δ. Both refer to the phasor in the complex plane whose real and imaginary parts are the resistive (lossy) component of an electromagnetic field and its reactive (lossless) counterpart.
         724. How does a TL's insertion impedance vary with respect to frequency?
         725. What is the skin effect? Where does it come up in TLs?
         1. Skin effect is the tendency of an alternating electric current to become distributed within a conductor such that the current density is largest near the surface of the conductor and decreases exponentially with greater depths in the conductor. 
         726. What is preemphasis? Why is it used? How can it be implemented?
         1. Typically, prior to some process, such as transmission over cable, or recording to phonograph record or tape, the input frequency range most susceptible to noise is boosted. This is referred to as "pre-emphasis" – before the process the signal will undergo.
         727. Draw the time-domain and frequency-domain spectrum of a signal with/without preemphasis.

Embedded Systems
         728. What are some components/subsystems you'd find in an embedded system?
         1. Generally, an embedded system comprises power supply, processor, memory, timers, serial communication ports and system application specific circuits. Embedded systems can be classified into different types based on performance, functional requirements and performance of the microcontroller.

         730. What are some common microcontrollers/microprocessors?
         1. Microcontrollers
         1. STM32F103C8T6
         2. ATmega328
         3. PIC16F877A
         4. Attiny85
         5. MSP430G2452
         6. ESP8266
         7. ESP32
         8. ATMEGA32U4
         2. Microprocessors
         1. Intel 386, Intel 486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, etc. RISC are IBM RS6000, DEC Alpha 21064, DEC Alpha 21164, etc. EPIC is IA-64 (Intel Architecture-64), etc.
         731. What is the difference between a microcontroller and a microprocessor?
         1. A microcontroller is like a miniaturized computer on a single chip. All the elements of a computer, such as CPU, memory, timers, and registers, are tightly integrated with each other. A microprocessor, on the other hand, is just the computing element (the CPU) in a computer.
         732. What are the blocks of a microcontroller and microprocessor?
         1. Microprocessor consists of only a Central Processing Unit, whereas Micro Controller contains a CPU, Memory, I/O all integrated into one chip. Microprocessor is used in Personal Computers whereas Micro Controller is used in an embedded system
         733. How does a microcontroller interact with external peripherals?
         1. External peripherals typically communicate via one of the aforementioned communications protocols, such as SPI or I2C. I2C protocol analyser inspecting traffic between external serial EEPROM and the PIC microcontroller.
         734. When do use MCU vs ASIC vs FPGA?
         735. How do you spec an MCU? What specs do you look for?
         736. What is a reset signal? What does it do? Why is it useful?
         1. In a computer or data transmission system, a reset clears any pending errors or events and brings a system to normal condition or an initial state, usually in a controlled manner.
Communication Buses
         737. What are the three common communication protocols? How do they (I2C, SPI, UART) work?
         1. I2C, SPI, UART
         738. What is the difference between I2C and SPI?
         1. I2C is half duplex communication and SPI is full duplex communication. I2C supports multi master and multi slave and SPI supports single master. I2C is a two wire protocol and SPI is a four wire protocol. I2C supports clock stretching and SPI does not have clock stretching.
         739. Which is faster? Why?
         1. SPI is superior in speed compared to I2C. Its push-pull drivers offer enhanced speed and signal integrity and its full-duplex support means master and slave devices can send data at the same time, allowing for even quicker data exchanges.
         740. How do different chips talk to each other?
         1. UART is a protocol where two chips are directly connected. The Tx of one chip is connected to the Rx of the other and vice-versa. This is not a scalable protocol, meaning that only two chips can talk to each other using one UART line.
         741. What is the difference between asynchronous vs synchronous communication? What are the tradeoffs?
         1. In Synchronous transmission data is sent in frames or blocks. In Asynchronous transmission data is sent in the form of bytes or characters.
         742. What are logic levels?
         1. In digital circuits, a logic level is one of a finite number of states that a digital signal can inhabit. Logic levels are usually represented by the voltage difference between the signal and ground, although other standards exist.
         743. What are some common logic levels?
         1. “Acceptable” input signal voltages range from 0 volts to 0.8 volts for a “low” logic state, and 2 volts to 5 volts for a “high” logic state. If a voltage signal ranging between 0.8 volts and 2 volts were to be sent into the input of a TTL gate, there would be no certain response from the gate.
I2C
         744. What is I2C? What does it stand for?
         1. I2C stands for the inter-integrated controller. This is a serial communication protocol that can connect low-speed devices. It is a master-slave communication in which we can connect and control multiple slaves from a single master. In this, each slave device has a specific address.
         745. How does it work? Explain its operation.
         1. It uses only 2 bi-directional open-drain lines for data communication called SDA and SCL. Both these lines are pulled high. Serial Data (SDA) – Transfer of data takes place through this pin. Serial Clock (SCL) – It carries the clock signal.
Protocol Layer
         746. How interface with slaves?
         747. How many slaves can there be?
         748. When would you need more masters?
         749. Explain address/data frames.
         750. How can you change a slave's address?
         751. Explain NACK/ACK.
         1. An Acknowledgement (ACK) or Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) is a short message sent by the receiver to the transmitter to indicate whether it has correctly or incorrectly received a data packet, respectively.
         752. Explain clock stretching.
         1. Clock stretching is a method for any I2C device to slow down the bus. The I2C clock speed is controlled by the master, but clock stretching allows all devices to slow down or even halt I2C communication. Clock stretching is performed by holding the SCL line low.
Physical Layer
         753. How many pins/wires are needed? What if I have more slaves?
         754. How do I make the connections? Draw it out.
         755. Why are pullups needed? How do you spec them?
         1. The pullup resistors pull the line high when it is not driven low by the open-drain interface. The value of the pullup resistor is an important design consideration for I2C systems as an incorrect value can lead to signal loss.
         756. What is bus capacitance?
         1. Bus capacitance is a collection of individual pin capacitance with respect to ground, the capacitance between the SDA and SCL, parasitic capacitance, capacitance added by the devices hanging on the bus, bus length (wire), dielectric material, etc. All these are reasons for accidental capacitors in the I2C bus.
         757. How would bus capacitance change? What impacts it?
         758. How do you increase rise time on I2C?
         759. Why would rise time be too slow on I2C?
         1. However, the signal edge rise time is very slow, which is causing communication to not work properly at higher sampling rates.
         760. If the logic low state of signal doesn't reach logic-low threshold of device, what could be happening?
         761. What are advantages of the open-drain output drivers?
         1. The advantages of the open-drain configuration are three-fold: first, the ability to directly drive a load; second, (and probably more importantly) the ability to switch external sources that may have higher or lower voltages than Vdd; and third, multiple open-drain sensors (such as the RR132) can be connected in an efficient way
         762. What are typical logic levels?
         1. In digital circuits, a logic level is one of a finite number of states that a digital signal can inhabit. Logic levels are usually represented by the voltage difference between the signal and ground, although other standards exist.
         763. What are typical clock speeds?
         1. A clock speed of 3.5 GHz to 4.0 GHz is generally considered a good clock speed for gaming but it's more important to have good single-thread performance. This means that your CPU does a good job of understanding and completing single tasks. This is not to be confused with having a single-core processor.
SPI
         764. What is SPI? What does it stand for?
         1. In a computer, a serial peripheral interface (SPI) is an interface that enables the serial (one bit at a time) exchange of data between two devices, one called a master and the other called a slave . An SPI operates in full duplex mode. This means that data can be transferred in both directions at the same time.
         765. How many slaves can there be?
         1. It is typical for a SPI master to control two to three slaves and not more. There is also no formal standard for the SPI protocol, so there is no benchmark for validating protocol conformance of a given product.
         766. How to interface with slaves?
         1. The SPI Slave provides an industry-standard, 4-wire slave SPI interface and 3-wire. It can also provide a 3-wire (bidirectional) SPI interface.
         767. How do I make the connections?
         768. How does daisy-chaining work?
         1. In daisy-chain mode, the subnodes are configured such that the chip select signal for all subnodes is tied together and data propagates from one subnode to the next. In this configuration, all subnodes receive the same SPI clock at the same time.
         769. What are typical logic levels?
         770. What are typical clock speeds?
         1. There is no standard set of speeds defined for the SPI protocol. Typical bus speeds are in the 50 MHz range. Since there is no overhead added by the protocol such as addressing and flow control, the throughput that can be achieved using SPI mirrors the clock frequency. For a 50 MHz SPI line, the throughput is 50 Mbps.
UART
         771. What is UART? What does it stand for?
         1. A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter is a computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
         772. How does it work?
         1. The UART interface does not use a clock signal to synchronize the transmitter and receiver devices; it transmits data asynchronously. Instead of a clock signal, the transmitter generates a bitstream based on its clock signal while the receiver is using its internal clock signal to sample the incoming data.
         773. How many wires does it have?
         1. Among the available communication protocols, UART uses only two wires for its transmitting and receiving ends.
         774. How do I make the connections?
         1. You can either attach the devices with a single cable that encompasses all TXD, RXD, CTS, RTS and other pins or you can attach individual jumper wires to each of these significant individual pins and connect them between the two devices.
         775. What are some standard communication rates?
         1. 110 Baud.
         2. 300 Baud.
         3. 1200 Baud.
         4. 4800 Baud.
         5. 9600 Baud.
         6. 19200 Baud.
         7. 38400 Baud.
         8. 115200 Baud.
         776. How many devices can talk to each other? What is the direction of communication?
         1. Two UARTs directly communicate with each other. The two signals of each UART device are named: Transmitter (Tx) Receiver (Rx)
         777. Is it synchronous or asynchronous?
         1. asynchronous
         778. Since there's no clock, how is data read?
         1. Instead of a clock signal, the transmitter generates a bitstream based on its clock signal while the receiver is using its internal clock signal to sample the incoming data.
         779. What is oversampling? How is it implemented? Why is it needed? What are some common oversample rates for UART?
         1. In signal processing, oversampling is the process of sampling a signal at a sampling frequency significantly higher than the Nyquist rate. Theoretically, a bandwidth-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed if sampled at the Nyquist rate or above it.
GPIOs
         780. What is a GPIO? What does it stand for and what are its use cases?
         1. A general-purpose input/output is an uncommitted digital signal pin on an integrated circuit or electronic circuit board which may be used as an input or output, or both, and is controllable by software. GPIOs have no predefined purpose and are unused by default.
         781. What does "GP" refer to?
         1. General purpose
         782. What can I do if I don't have enough GPIOs?
         1. Another way of driving lots of LEDs is to use something like the PCA9685 IC which uses I2C in order to give you up to 16 extra PWM outputs. You can also have multiple of these on the I2C if you need more, but this may limit data rates.
Design/Implementation
A lot on GPIO design is very applicable, more in-depth questions are covered in the CMOS and Amplifiers subsections of Analog Electronics. These questions will just be surface-level that are more applicable in embedded applications.
         783. Draw a GPIO circuit. How does it work?
  



         784. What are the two most common types of GPIO implementations? What are their tradeoffs?
         785. What does open-drain/push-pull mean?
         1. Output pins can be driven in three different modes: open drain - a transistor connects to low and nothing else. open drain, with pull-up - a transistor connects to low, and a resistor connects to high. push-pull - a transistor connects to high, and a transistor connects to low (only one is operated at a time)
         786. When are pullup/pulldown resistors necessary? How do you size them?
         1. Pull-up and pull-down resistors are often used when interfacing a switch or some other input with a microcontroller or other digital gates. Most microcontrollers have built-in programmable pull-up and/or pull-down resistors, so fewer external components are needed.
         787. What are some typical configurable GPIO settings?
         788. What is bus contention?
         1. Bus contention is an undesirable state in computer design where more than one device on a bus attempts to place values on it at the same time.
Timers
         789. What are timers in a microcontroller?
         1. A timer (sometimes referred to as a counter) is a special piece of hardware inside many microcontrollers. Their function is simple: they count (up or down, depending on the configuration--we'll assume up for now). For example, an 8-bit timer will count from 0 to 255.
         790. What can you do with timers?
         1. Their main purpose is to measure time and count external events. Besides, they are used for generating clock pulses that can be used in serial communication, so-called Baud Rate.
         791. How do you keep track of time accurately in a microcontroller?
         1. A clock source is selected with a multiplexer and input to a prescaler which divides the clock by a factor of 32,768 (215) to produce a one-second clock. A basic RTC has a seconds counter which is usually 32 bits or more. Some RTCs have specialized counters to keep track of the time of day and the calendar date
         792. How do they work? How are they implemented?
         793. What are some applications?
         1. Some of the applications of Timer IC are: LED Flasher; Frequency generation; As a memory unit; Turn on a device for a certain time.
Interrupts
         794. If you want to do something right when an external event occurs, what can you do?
         795. What are interrupts in a microcontroller?
         1. Interrupts are the events that temporarily suspend the main program, pass the control to the external sources and execute their task. It then passes the control to the main program where it had left off.
         796. How do they work? How are they implemented?
         1. An interrupt is a signal emitted by a device attached to a computer or from a program within the computer. It requires the operating system (OS) to stop and figure out what to do next. An interrupt temporarily stops or terminates a service or a current process.
         797. Describe how ISRs work at the hardware and software levels.
         798. What are some applications?
         1. Applications of interrupts include the following: system timers, disk I/O, power-off signals, and traps. Other interrupts exist to transfer data bytes using UARTs or Ethernet; sense key-presses; or anything else the equipment must do.
         799. What can trigger ISRs?
         800. What are some limitations of interrupts?
         801. What is an interrupt service routine (ISR)?
         1. In computer systems programming, an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a special block of code associated with a specific interrupt condition
         802. What are some rules of thumb when implementing ISRs?
         1. Don't declare any non-static variables inside the handler.
         2. Avoid blocking function calls.
         3. Avoid non-reentrant function calls.
         4. Avoid any processing that takes non-trivial time.
         5. Avoid operations with locks as you can deadlock your program in an ISR.
         803. What happens if an ISR gets called while in an ISR? How can this be avoided?
         1. The code sets the "Global Interrupt Enable" bit; without it, no interrupts will occur.
         2. When something happens to cause an interrupt, a flag is set.
         3. When the interrupt flag is noticed, the "Global Interrupt Enable" bit is cleared.
         4. The appropriate ISR is run.
         5. The "Global Interrupt Enable" bit is re-set.
         6. Things now go back to step 2, unless an interrupt flag is already set during the ISR; then things go back to step 3.
         7. So to answer the question: When the first ISR is finished, the second ISR will be run.
Peripherals
A lot of the inductive drive questions have good overlap with the Single-Phase Inductive Drives section (Power Electronics > Inductive Loads > Single-Phase Inductive Drives).
         804. Draw a circuit to connect a sensor to a microcontroller.
         805. Draw a circuit to connect a button to a microcontroller.
         806. Draw a circuit to drive a LED from a microcontroller. What about a high-power LED? What if I want to change the brightness?
         807. Draw a circuit to drive a motor from a microcontroller. What if isolation is required? What if I want to change the speed?
ADC
Most of my ADC/DAC questions have been in the context of embedded systems, not too much on analog design or anything.
         808. How does an ADC work?
         1. ADCs follow a sequence when converting analog signals to digital. They first sample the signal, then quantify it to determine the resolution of the signal, and finally set binary values and send it to the system to read the digital signal. Two important aspects of the ADC are its sampling rate and resolution.
         809. How does a flash ADC work?
         1. A flash ADC (also known as a direct-conversion ADC) is a type of analog-to-digital converter that uses a linear voltage ladder with a comparator at each "rung" of the ladder to compare the input voltage to successive reference voltages.
         810. How does a SAR ADC work?
         1. The SAR ADC does the following things for each sample: The analog signal is sampled and held. For each bit, the SAR logic outputs a binary code to the DAC that is dependent on the current bit under scrutiny and the previous bits already approximated. The comparator is used to determine the state of the current bit.
         811. Design an ADC.
         1. 12-bit Resolution with Enhanced Mode up to 14 bits.
         2. 1 Msps Conversion Rate.
         3. Digital Averaging Function providing Enhanced Resolution Mode up to 14 bits.
         4. Wide Range of Power Supply Operation.
         5. Selectable Single-Ended or Differential Input Voltage.
         6. Digital correction of offset and gain errors.
         812. Reading the ADC from your microcontroller returns some value. Given the value and the ADC supply voltages, convert this reading into a voltage.
         813. What is sampling?
         1. When a source generates an analog signal and if that has to be digitized, having 1s and 0s i.e., High or Low, the signal has to be discretized in time. This discretization of analog signal is called as Sampling.
         814. What is sample and hold?
         1. In electronics, a sample and hold circuit is an analog device that samples the voltage of a continuously varying analog signal and holds its value at a constant level for a specified minimum period of time. Sample and hold circuits and related peak detectors are the elementary analog memory devices
         815. How the the sample voltage maintained throughout the entire sample duration?
         816. Design a sample and hold circuit.
         817. What are the tradeoffs between super fast/slow sample and hold durations?
         818. What are some ADC frontends?
         819. What is the precision of an ADC? Calculate it given all the required info.
         1. The ADC precision is the number of distinguishable ADC inputs (e.g., 4096 alternatives, 12 bits). The ADC range is the maximum and minimum ADC input (e.g., 0 to +3.3V). The ADC resolution is the smallest distinguishable change in input (e.g., 3.3V/4095, which is about 0.81 mV).
DAC
Most of my ADC/DAC questions have been in the context of embedded systems, not too much on analog design or anything. 
820. How does a DAC work?
A DAC takes digital data and transforms it into an analog audio signal. Afterward, it sends that analog signal to an amplifier. When you hear digital recordings, you're actually listening to an analog signal that was converted from digital by a DAC.
821. Design a DAC. 
  

822. What is the precision of a DAC? Calculate it given all the required info.
Discrete precision DACs up to 20-bit resolution.
Data Storage and Memory
         823. How does a microcontroller store memory and data?
         1. The program of the microcontroller is stored in the memory. There are two types of memory: RAM (Random Access Memory) which can read and write data, and ROM (Read Only Memory) which mainly stores programs as read-only data. There are various types of RAM and ROM depending on the usage.
         824. If I need to store more memory than what the microcontroller has space for, what can I do?
         1. Expanded memory access beyond 64kB is most frequently done through bank switching. This technique uses one or more general purpose I/O lines as decode lines to address more memory. If a single large-capacity memory device is used, the additional signals can be used directly as address lines.
         825. What if I want memory to persist after the microcontroller powers off?
         1. Blu-Ray disc.
         2. CD-ROM disc.
         3. CD-R and CD-RW disc.
         4. DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, and DVD+RW disc.
         5. Floppy diskette.
         6. Hard drive.
         7. Jump drive or flash drive.
         8. Memory card.
         826. What does non-volatile (NV) memory mean?
         1. Non-volatile memory or non-volatile storage is a type of computer memory that can retain stored information even after power is removed. In contrast, volatile memory needs constant power in order to retain data. 
         827. What is ROM?
         1. Read-only memory is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM cannot be electronically modified after the manufacture of the memory device.
         828. What is an EEPROM?
         1. EEPROM (also called E2PROM) stands for electrically erasable programmable read-only memory and is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers, usually integrated in microcontrollers such as smart cards and remote keyless systems, or as a separate chip device to store relatively small amounts of data by allowing individual bytes to be erased and reprogrammed.
         829. What are registers?
         1. A processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's processor. Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only.
         830. Given a register map and the register value in hex, find the value of each register field.
Debugging Embedded Systems
         831. How do you debug a microcontroller? What are some challenges at hardware vs software levels?
         1. In-circuit debugging (ICD) is the most powerful fault-finding technique available for microcontrollers. It allows the chip to be programmed and tested in circuit using the standard MPLAB debugging tools to control program execution in the actual target board.
         832. What is a debugger?
         1. A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program used to test and debug other programs. The main use of a debugger is to run the target program under controlled conditions that permit the programmer to track its execution and monitor changes in computer resources that may indicate malfunctioning code.
         833. What if your IDE/microcontroller doesn't have a hardware debugger?
         1. The debugger component of an IDE typically provides the programmer with the capability to view memory and see variables, run the program to the next breakpoint, execute just the next line of code, and, in some cases, change the value of variables or even change the contents of the line of code about to be executed.
         834. If a microcontroller isn't booting up, what should you check for?
Operating Systems
Very brief questions on operating systems, usually in the context of embedded systems.
         835. What is an operating system?
         1. An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
         836. Name some operating systems.
         1.  Apple macOS
         2. Microsoft Windows
         3. Google's Android OS
         4. Linux Operating System 
         5. Apple iOS
         837. When is it needed?
         1. An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.
         838. What is bare-metal programming?
         1. Bare-metal programming is a term for programming that operates without various layers of abstraction or, as some experts describe it, "without an operating system supporting it." Bare-metal programming interacts with a system at the hardware level, taking into account the specific build of the hardware.
         839. What advantages does it have over bare-metal?
         1. The most significant difference is usually memory protection and virtualization. In a high-end operating system, application memory is separated, and the OS ensures that one process (running application) cannot corrupt the memory of another process. This is done by virtualizing the memory.
         840. What is a real-time operating system (RTOS)?
         1. A real-time operating system is an operating system for real-time applications that processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints.

Sensors
         841. What is a sensor?
         1. A sensor is a device that produces an output signal for the purpose of sensing a physical phenomenon. In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor.
         842. What are some applications of sensors?
         1. Some household appliance applications using sensors are the boiler, washing machines and dishwashers for heating systems, and other white products. Many vehicles, including automobiles, trains, buses, etc., employ sensors to monitor petroleum temperature and pressure, jets and steering systems, and so many more.
         843. Name some types of sensors. What are they used for?
         1. Temperature Sensor.
         2. Proximity Sensor.
         3. Accelerometer.
         4. IR Sensor (Infrared Sensor)
         5. Pressure Sensor.
         6. Light Sensor.
         7. Ultrasonic Sensor.
         8. Smoke, Gas and Alcohol Sensor.
         844. What is a transducer?
         1. A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another. Usually a transducer converts a signal in one form of energy to a signal in another.
         845. What is sensor fusion?
         1. Sensor fusion is the process of combining sensor data or data derived from disparate sources such that the resulting information has less uncertainty than would be possible when these sources were used individually.
Gyroscope/Accelerometer
         846. What is a gyroscope/accelerometer?
         1. Accelerometers measure linear acceleration (specified in mV/g) along one or several axis. A gyroscope measures angular velocity (specified in mV/deg/s). If we take our accelerometer and impose a rotation to it (i.e., a roll) 
         847. What are its applications?
         1. Indoor Navigation. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
         2. Optical Image Stabilization. Human hands shake at a very low frequency (10Hz to 20Hz).
         3. Gesture-Based Control.
         848. What is the difference between a gyroscope and accelerometer? Why are they often used together?
         1. Using the key principles of angular momentum, the gyroscope helps indicate orientation. In comparison, the accelerometer measures linear acceleration based on vibration. The typical two-axis accelerometer gives users a direction of gravity in an aircraft, smartphone, car or other device.
         849. How can you determine position/velocity from the accelerometer data?
         1. The sensor will provide you with the value of acceleration at any given time. But acceleration can vary quite significantly during huge time intervals so keep the time intervals 't' small. Lets say t = 10ms (depends on you). So calculate V after every 10ms intervale and this will give you current velocity at any given time.
         850. What is an inertial measurement unit (IMU)? What are its trade offs?
         1. An inertial measurement unit is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers. When the magnetometer is included, IMUs are referred to as IMMUs.
Light
         851. What can you use to measure light? What does that even mean?
         1. A photometer is an instrument that measures light intensity. It can be defined as an instrument that measures visible light. Luminance measurements are used for products such as traffic lights and automobile tail lights.
         852. What properties of light do you look for? How can those properties be detected.
         1. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization.
         853. What are the tradeoffs of photoresistors vs photodiodes?
         1. LDR (photoresistor) is a passive device that does not convert light energy but rather it uses light energy to increase the conductivity of the LDR. On the other hand, photodiode converts light into the electrical energy readily available in solar panels.
         854. What are some applications of light measurement?
         1. The Candela. This unit is used to describe luminous intensity, which is how strong light appears to a human eye
         2. Lumen. The lumen is used to measure the total luminous flux of a light bulb
         3. Lux
         4. Placement Detection
         5. Brightness Control
         6. Security
         7. Planning
         8. Agriculture
         855. How can light measurement be used in conjunction with other sensors to determine stuff?
         1. Common types of light sensors are photodiodes, photoresistors, phototransistors, and photovoltaic light sensors. These components can be used in applications such as light sensing in mobile devices, automatic outdoor lighting, proximity sensors, and renewable energy.
Camera
         856. How does a camera work?
         1. A camera lens takes all the light rays bouncing around and uses glass to redirect them to a single point, creating a sharp image. When all of those light rays meet back together on a digital camera sensor or a piece of film, they create a sharp image.
         857. What is optical image stabilization (OIS)? What is electronic image stabilization? What is the difference (EIS)? What are each of their applications?
         1. OIS is a hardware solution that uses a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope to detect movement and adjust the camera system accordingly
         858. How does night mode on smartphone cameras work?
         1. Night Mode uses a variation of the HDR technique. It captures different images of the same subject at varying exposure levels
         859. What are some techniques to reduce image noise?
         1. Shoot in Raw.
         2. Get a correct exposure.
         3. Keep the ISO under control.
         4. Be careful when taking long exposures.
         5. Use large apertures.
         6. Turn on your camera noise reduction.
         7. Take advantage of your camera's high ISO noise reduction (if you shoot in Jpeg).
         860. How does ambient lighting impact camera performance?
         1. The effects of ambient light on the camera's image quality are most pronounced in the depth map or point cloud. In scenes with strong ambient light in the 920–970 nm range, the depth noise increases, thus reducing the precision of the depth measurement.
         861. How do you characterize camera quality?
         1. The quality and composition of a digital camera is mainly defined by four quantities: resolution, lens aperture, lens focal length / zoom range, lens quality, sensor sensitivity, and camera software.
         862. Describe the camera processing pipeline.
         1. An image pipeline or video pipeline is the set of components commonly used between an image source (such as a camera, a scanner, or the rendering engine in a computer game), and an image renderer (such as a television set, a computer screen, a computer printer or cinema screen), or for performing any intermediate digital image processing consisting of two or more separate processing blocks. An image/video pipeline may be implemented as computer software, in a digital signal processor, on an FPGA, or as fixed-function ASIC. In addition, analog circuits can be used to do many of the same functions.
         863. How does a smartphone take pictures? Describe what happens when you press the button? (and also before you press the button!)
         1. All smartphone cameras are made of three basic parts. The first is the lens that directs light into the camera. The second is the sensor that converts the focused photons of light into an electrical signal. And the third is the software that converts those electrical signals into an Instagram-ready photo
LiDAR
         864. What is LiDAR?
         1. Lidar is a method for determining ranges by targeting an object or a surface with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver.
         865. How does it work?
         1. A typical lidar sensor emits pulsed light waves into the surrounding environment. These pulses bounce off surrounding objects and return to the sensor. The sensor uses the time it took for each pulse to return to the sensor to calculate the distance it traveled.
         866. What are some applications?
         1. Lidar is commonly used to make high-resolution maps, with applications in surveying, geodesy, geomatics, archaeology, geography, geology, geomorphology, seismology, forestry, atmospheric physics, laser guidance, airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM), and laser altimetry.
         867. What is the difference between LiDAR and just a regular camera?
         1. The fundamental difference between Lidar and camera technology is that Lidar emits the light it sees, whereas cameras don't. This gives Lidar the ability to calculate incredibly accurate distances to many objects that are simultaneously detected.
         868. How do you map the world 360 degrees all around you?
         869. How would you describe the product of a lidar sensor?
         1. A typical lidar sensor emits pulsed light waves into the surrounding environment. These pulses bounce off surrounding objects and return to the sensor. The sensor uses the time it took for each pulse to return to the sensor to calculate the distance it traveled.
         870. What are some factors that may impact accuracy?
         1. The reflective percentages are referred to as LiDAR intensity. But several factors affect light intensity. For example, range, incident angle, beam, receiver, and surface composition (especially) influences light intensity. An example is when the pulse is tilted further away, the return energy decreases.
Calibration, Validation, and Testing
         871. How do you calibrate/validate/test a sensor? Describe what you would want to test and design an experiment.
         1. Take a measurement with your sensor.
         2. Compare that measurement with your reference standard.
         3. Subtract the sensor reading from the reference reading to get the offet.
         4. In your code, add the offset to every sensor reading to obtain the calibrated value.
         872. What are some things you want to validate in a sensor?
         1. The best way to validate a new sensor is to perform experiments on a wide range of unmodified, unspiked samples, and to cross correlate the data with a reference method. Gas sensors may be cross-correlated with GC-MS, and a new ion sensing principle with an established probe for the same ion.
         873. How do you characterize measurement error? What can you do with that information?
         1. Measurement error is the difference between the observed value of a Variable and the true, but unobserved, value of that Variable.

Digital Basics
         874. What is the difference between analog and digital?
         1. The difference between analog and digital technologies is that in analog technology, information is translated into electric pulses of varying amplitude. In digital technology, translation of information is into binary format (zero or one) where each bit is representative of two distinct amplitudes.
         875. What is the difference between big and small endian?
         1. Big-endian is an order in which the "big end" (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first, at the lowest storage address. Little-endian is an order in which the "little end" (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first.
         876. What does the MSB and LSB refer to?
         1. In a binary number, the bit furthest to the left is called the most significant bit (msb) and the bit furthest to the right is called the least significant bit (lsb).
Digital Electronics
         877. How can you interface two devices with different logic levels?
         1. At any one time only one of these transistors can be 'on', and the other must be 'off'. If the upper transistor is 'on', the output voltage is at logic high level, and if the lower transistor is 'on' then the output is at logic low level.
         878. Design a level shifter.
  



         879. Design a single-FET level shifter (passives are allowed).
  

         880. What are setup and hold times? What happens if they're violated?
         1. Setup time is the amount of time required for the input to a Flip-Flop to be stable before a clock edge. Hold time is similar to setup time, but it deals with events after a clock edge occurs. Hold time is the minimum amount of time required for the input to a Flip-Flop to be stable after a clock edge.
         881. What is the difference between a flip-flop and latch?
         1. The major difference between flip-flop and latch is that the flip-flop is an edge-triggered type of memory circuit while the latch is a level-triggered type. It means that the output of a latch changes whenever the input changes.
         882. How does a flip flop/latch work?
         883. Design a memory cell.  
         884. Why are clocks needed?
            1. The signal acts like a metronome, which the digital circuit follows in time to coordinate its sequence of actions. Digital circuits rely on clock signals to know when and how to execute the functions that are programmed.
            885. What happens if a clock is too fast?
            1. If the clock runs too fast, there may not be enough time to complete the required operations before the next set begins—the processor interfaces with a range of different component blocks, from dynamic memory to interface pins.
            886. What is a register?
            1. A register is a group of binary cells suitable for holding binary information. A group of cascaded flip-flops used to store related bits of information is known as a register.
            887. What is metastability?
            1. In electronics, metastability is the ability of a digital electronic system to persist for an unbounded time in an unstable equilibrium or metastable state.
            888. What is a mux?
            1. In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux; spelled sometimes as multiplexor), also known as a data selector, is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as select lines.

            891. Draw the truth table for NOT/AND/etc gate.
  

            892. What is the universal logic gate?
            1. A universal gate is a gate which can implement any Boolean function without need to use any other gate type. The NAND and NOR gates are universal gates. In practice, this is advantageous since NAND and NOR gates are economical and easier to fabricate and are the basic gates used in all IC digital logic families.
            893. Convert some binary/hex/oct/decimal number to a different base.
            1. Step 1 − Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value of the new base. Step 2 − Get the remainder from Step 1 as the rightmost digit (least significant digit) of new base number. Step 3 − Divide the quotient of the previous divide by the new base.
Digital Logic
            894. What is a truth table?
            1. A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic—specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus—which sets out the functional values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables.
            895. Do the K-map for a given truth table.
            1. A Karnaugh map (K-map) is a visual method used to simplify the algebraic expressions in Boolean functions without having to resort to complex theorems or equation manipulations.
            896. What is an FSM?
            1. A finite-state machine or finite-state automaton, finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.
            897. What is the difference between a Mealy and Moore FSM?
            1. A Mealy Machine changes its output on the basis of its present state and current input. A Moore Machine's output depends only on the current state. It does not depend on the current input.

            1. A system architecture primarily concentrates on the internal interfaces among the system's components or subsystems, and on the interface(s) between the system and its external environment, especially the user
            900. What is a CPU?
            1. A central processing unit, also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations specified by the instructions in the program
            901. What are some blocks in a CPU?
            1. The CPU itself has three components, namely, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit (CU), and memory unit (MU).
            902. What is an ALU?
            1. In computing, an arithmetic logic unit is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit, which operates on floating point numbers.
            903. What is the program counter?
            1. The program counter, commonly called the instruction pointer in Intel x86 and Itanium microprocessors, and sometimes called the instruction address register, the instruction counter, or just part of the instruction sequencer, is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence.
            904. How does the contents of the program counter change over time?
            1. Usually, the PC is incremented after fetching an instruction, and holds the memory address of ("points to") the next instruction that would be executed.
            905. What is the fetch/execute cycle?
            1. The basic operation of a computer is called the 'fetch-execute' cycle. The CPU is designed to understand a set of instructions - the instruction set. It fetches the instructions from the main memory and executes them. This is done repeatedly from when the computer is booted up to when it is shut down.
            906. Describe the five-stage pipeline.
            1. In the early days of computer hardware, Reduced Instruction Set Computer Central Processing Units (RISC CPUs) was designed to execute one instruction per cycle, five stages in total. Those stages are, Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write.
            907. How can you offload tasks from the CPU? What are things you can do in parallel and what are the tradeoffs?
            1. In short, offloading or acceleration is the process by which computing tasks are offloaded onto computer hardware or systems that have been specially designed to perform particular functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on a general-purpose CPU.
            908. What can you do to increase the throughput of a CPU?
            1. One of the more complicated ways to get increased performance from your CPU is to overclock it. Overclocking is where you push your computer's components harder and faster than the manufacturers intended them to go. And whilst it can most definitely speed up your system, it can often be quite complicated.
            909. What is pipelining?
            1. In computer engineering, instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level parallelism within a single processor
            910. What is branch prediction? Describe some branch prediction algorithms.
            1. In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch will go before this is known definitively. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. 
            911. What are interrupts? When can they be used and why are they important? How does their usage often differ from that of embedded systems?
            1. In digital computers, an interrupt is a request for the processor to interrupt currently executing code, so that the event can be processed in a timely manner.
            912. What is microarchitecture?
            1. In computer engineering, microarchitecture, also called computer organization and sometimes abbreviated as µarch or uarch, is the way a given instruction set architecture is implemented in a particular processor.
            913. What is an instruction set architecture (ISA)?
            1. In computer science, an instruction set architecture, also called computer architecture, is an abstract model of a computer. A device that executes instructions described by that ISA, such as a central processing unit, is called an implementation.
            914. What is the difference between microarchitecture and ISA?
            1. An ISA is a structure of commands and operations used by software to communicate with hardware. A microarchitecture is the hardware circuitry that implements one particular ISA. For example, x86-64 is the ISA used by most modern laptop and desktop computers.
            915. What is RISC-V?
            1. RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture based on established RISC principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use.
            916. Does RISC-V specify the ISA or microarchitecture?
            1. RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five" where five refers to the number of generations of RISC architecture that were developed at the University of California, Berkeley since 1981) is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established RISC principles.
            917. What are some advantages of RISC vs CISC?
            1. The argument for RISC over CISC is that having a less complicated set of instructions makes designing a CPU easier, cheaper and quicker. The primary difference between RISC and CISC architecture is that RISC-based machines execute one instruction per clock cycle.
            918. How do you characterize CPU performance?
            1. Processor cores and clock speeds determine how much information can be received at a time, and how quickly that information can be processed on your computer. The speed at which your computer's cores and clock speed work together is considered its processing speed.
GPU
            919. What is a GPU?
            1. A graphics processing unit is a specialized electronic circuit designed to manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
            920. How does a GPU work?
            1. So, the CPU sends information regarding what needs to appear on screen to the graphics card. In turn, the graphics card takes those instructions and runs them through its own processing unit, rapidly updating its onboard memory (known as VRAM) as to which pixels on the screen need changing and how.
            921. What does the GPU pipeline look like?
            1. A graphics pipeline can be divided into three major steps: application, geometry and rasterization.
            922. What is the difference between a GPU and CPU?
            1. The main difference between CPU and GPU architecture is that a CPU is designed to handle a wide-range of tasks quickly (as measured by CPU clock speed), but are limited in the concurrency of tasks that can be running. A GPU is designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video concurrently.
            923. What optimizations does a GPU have so it vastly outperforms CPUs in graphics tasks? What are the tradeoffs?
            1. High Data Throughput: a GPU consists of hundreds of cores performing the same operation on multiple data items in parallel. Because of that, a GPU can push vast volumes of processed data through a workload, speeding up specific tasks beyond what a CPU can handle.
            924. How do you characterize GPU performance?
            1.  GPU memory can be measured in several ways – size (bits), amount of available memory (MB), clock rate (MHz), and bandwidth (GB/s). RAMDAC speed impacts the image quality, how often the screen can be refreshed per second, and the maximum resolution you can display.
            925. What are other tasks that GPUs may excel at besides graphics processing? Why?
            1. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine learning, video editing, and gaming applications. GPUs may be integrated into the computer's CPU or offered as a discrete hardware unit.
System on Chip (SoC)
            926. What is a SoC?
            1. A system on a chip or system-on-chip is an integrated circuit that integrates most or all components of a computer or other electronic system.
            927. What are its applications?
            1. SoCs can be applied to any computing task. However, they are typically used in mobile computing such as tablets, smartphones, smartwatches and netbooks as well as embedded systems and in applications where previously microcontrollers would be used.
            928. What are some components on a SoC?
            1. Operating system.
            2. Utility software applications.
            3. Voltage regulators and power management circuits.
            4. Timing sources such as phase lock loop control systems or oscillators.
            5. A microprocessor, microcontroller or digital signal processor.
            929. What are some tradeoffs between going for a SoC vs all separate components?
            1. Along with a processor, the SoC usually contains a GPU (graphics processor), memory, USB controller, power management circuits, and wireless radios. Because an SoC includes both the hardware and software, it uses less power, has better performance, requires less space and is more reliable than multichip systems.
            930. When designing a system, what other components are needed in addition to a SoC?
            1. A system-on-a-chip architecture, or SoC architecture, describes a complex integrated circuit that incorporates processor cores, memory, hardware logic, peripherals, and other components, all connected by communications systems such as internal data buses or networks.
            931. What is a system on module (SoM)? What is the difference/tradeoffs vs a SoC?
            1. A system on a module is a board-level circuit that integrates a system function in a single module. It may integrate digital and analog functions on a single board. A typical application is in the area of embedded systems. Unlike a single-board computer, a SoM serves a special function like a system on a chip.
            932. What are some tradeoffs of integration?
            933. Which blocks of the SoC consume the most power?
            1. The components of SoC include CPU, GPU, Memory, I/O devices, etc. SoC is used in various devices such as smartphones, Internet of Things appliances, tablets, and embedded system applications.
Memory
            934. Where can data and program be stored in memory?
            1. Main memory. Data and program stored in the Main memory when the processor uses them
            935. What is the difference between data and program memory?
            1. Program memory is normally used for storing program code, i.e. instructions. Data memory is used for storing program data.
            936. Explain the memory hierarchy. What are the tradeoffs of each? What type of data is stored in each?
            1. In computer architecture, the memory hierarchy separates computer storage into a hierarchy based on response time. Since response time, complexity, and capacity are related, the levels may also be distinguished by their performance and controlling technologies
            937. What is a cache?
            1. In computing, a cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. 
            938. What are registers?
            1. A processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's processor. Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only.
            939. What is RAM?
            1. Random-access memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
            940. What does "random access" refer to?
            1. Random access (more precisely and more generally called direct access) is the ability to access an arbitrary element of a sequence in equal time or any datum from a population of addressable elements roughly as easily and efficiently as any other, no matter how many elements may be in the set.
            941. What is stack overflow?
            1. A stack overflow is a type of buffer overflow error that occurs when a computer program tries to use more memory space in the call stack than has been allocated to that stack.
            942. What is the difference between the stack and the heap?
            1. ​​Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution. Whenever an object is created, it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it
            943. What is a memory management unit (MMU)? What does it do and why is it needed?
            1. A memory management unit, sometimes called paged memory management unit, is a computer hardware unit having all memory references passed through itself, primarily performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical addresses.
            944. If I'm operating my computer in space where there can be lots of radiation that can corrupt my memory, what issues can arise? What can I do to be resilient against these effects?
Power/Performance/Thermals
            945. How does clock frequency impact power, performance, and thermals?
            1. In general, power consumption increases linearly with clock frequecy. On each clock tick, many nodes within the CPU are being charged or discharged in order to perform computation. This charge or energy is thus dissapated during that clock tick. The more times you do that per second, the more power you dissipate.
            946. Why are multiple clock domains needed?
            1. Large systems are usually divided into several clock domains. Each domain has their own clocks and communication between them is asynchronous.
            947. How does supply voltage impact power, performance, and thermals?
            1. The absolute maximum rated supply voltage is the maximum voltage that can be supplied between the positive supply (VCC) and negative supply (VEE) pins without causing characteristics degradation or damage to the internal circuit.
            948. Why are multiple supply voltages needed?
            1. Multiple supply voltage design is an effective technique for power minimization in CMOS circuits. Clustered Voltage Scaling (CVS) and Extended Clustered Voltage Scaling (ECVS) are the two major methodologies used for assigning the voltage supply to gates in circuits having dual power supplies.
            949. How does process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) impact power, performance, and thermals?
            1. PVT is the Process, Voltage, and Temperature. In order to make our chip to work after fabrication in all the possible conditions, we simulate it at different corners of process, voltage, and temperature. These conditions are called corners. All these three parameters directly affect the delay of the cell. A lower threshold voltage means a higher current and therefore a better delay performance.
            950. What are process corners? What do they refer to?
            1. In semiconductor manufacturing, a process corner is an example of a design-of-experiments technique that refers to a variation of fabrication parameters used in applying an integrated circuit design to a semiconductor wafer.
            951. What are typical temperature ranges for validation?
            1. Anything under 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) is perfect. Just above this temperature is okay, but as you creep above 70 degrees C (158 degrees F), you need to look at how to cool your PC down. Above 80 degrees C (176 degrees F) is too hot and could cause damage to your computer if you run it for a sustained period.
            952. What can you do to decrease power consumption?
            1. Shutdown your computer. Computers are some of the biggest energy users in office buildings.
            2. Choose the right light.
            3. Eliminate vampire power: unplug idle electronics.
            4. Use a power strip to reduce your plug load.
            5. Turn off the lights.
            953. What can you do to throttle performance?
            1. Step 1: Install a Cold Air Intake. One of the best ways to improve throttle response is to install a cold air intake.
            2. Step 2: Upgrade the Exhaust System.
            3. Step 3: Install a Throttle Body Spacer.
            4. Step 4: Replace Spark Plugs and Wires.
            5. Step 5: Change Air Filters.
            954. What sort of temperature control loops are commonly implemented?
            1. A temperature control loop is designed to measure and control the temperature of a process. A typical process whose temperature is required to be controlled is an Oven which has a heater. Another very common process in the home is water bath temperature in a water heater whose temperature is controlled by a thermostat.
            955. What is power, performance, area (PPA)? Describe the tradeoffs.
            1. PPA stands for power, performance and area, and historically these have been the three variables used in deciding how to optimize semiconductor designs. Until 65nm, cost, which is a function of area, and performance, were the most-cited criteria for a successful design.
RTL
            956. Describe any experience you have with RTL.
            957. Design a clock divider.
            958. Design an arbiter. What are the different types and their tradeoffs?
            959. Design a mux.
            960. What is a module?
            1. A module is a distinct assembly of components that can be easily added, removed or replaced in a larger system. Generally, a module is not functional on its own. In computer hardware, a module is a component that is designed for easy replacement.
            961. How is RTL reused? Why is this important?
            1. Register Transfer Level (RTL) is an abstraction for defining the digital portions of a design. It is the principle abstraction used for defining electronic systems today and often serves as the golden model in the design and verification flow.
Assembly
            962. What is assembly? How does it differ from programming languages like C or Python?
            1. In computer programming, assembly language, often referred to simply as Assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.
            963. Describe what this given program is doing. How long will it take to run? How many times will {some subroutine} get executed?

            * C
            * C++
            * Python
            966. What are your strongest coding languages? How would you rate yourself in them?
            967. What is regex?
            1. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.
Variables
            968. What are the basic variable types?
            1. Constants, global variables, class variables, instance variables, and local variables.
            2. Also:
            1. int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.
            2. double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.
            3. char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. ... 
            4. string - stores text, such as "Hello World". ... 
            5. bool - stores values with two states: true or false.
            969. What is the difference between strings and chars? How are strings usually implemented?
            1. String in C programming is a sequence of characters terminated with a null character '\0'. Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a unique character '\0'
            970. What does the volatile keyword refer to? When should volatile variables be used?
            1. Volatile is a qualifier that is applied to a variable when it is declared. It tells the compiler that the value of the variable may change at any time-without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby.
Programming Questions
            971. Write psuedocode to achieve some given functionality.
            972. Walk through how a given program works.

System Architecture
"System architecture" is one of the vaguest engineering words with no meaning. I literally but it on my resume for that reason LOL. These questions are mostly focused on systems at a higher level to achieve some given functionality.
            974. What components does a smartphone/laptop have?
            1. It has the same basic hardware, such as CPU, RAM, memory, storage, and software components, such as operating systems and applications. Therefore, it can do anything a computer does, only in a more portable case
            975. Design a system to achieve:

            976. What is redundancy in a system? When is it preferred? How can you design a system with redundancy?
            1. In engineering, redundancy is the intentional duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the goal of increasing reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of GNSS receivers, or multi-threaded computer.
            977. What are some system design constraints in consumer electronics vs automotive vs aerospace/space/defense vs medical devices?
________________


Measurement
            978. What tools can you use to measure stuff?
            1. The ammeter, voltmeter, wattmeter are the examples of the electrical measuring instrument. The ammeter measures the current in amps; voltmeter measures voltage and Wattmeter are used for measuring the power.
            979. How familiar are you with:
            * DMMs
            * Scopes
            * VNAs
            * Power supplies, maybe with more functions like multiple quadrants or SMUs
            980. What sample rate/bandwidth will I need to measure a signal?
            1.             2. The choice of sampling rate is determined from the highest frequency present in significant amount in the signal. For audio signals we may have frequencies to above 50kHz, but only want to respond to 20kHz and below. In this case filtering would be needed to remove these high frequencies before sampling takes place.
            981. How should I measure X signal?
            982. How can I measure current?
            1. The most common way to measure current in a circuit is to break the circuit open and insert an “ammeter” in series (in-line) with the circuit so that all electrons flowing through the circuit also have to go through the meter.
            983. What is the difference between bandwidth and sampling rate?
            1. Sampling rate determines the sound frequency range (corresponding to pitch) which can be represented in the digital waveform. The range of frequencies represented in a waveform is often called its bandwidth.
            984. What is a VNA?
            1. A vendor neutral archive (VNA) is a technology that stores medical images in a standard format and interface, making them accessible to healthcare professionals regardless of what proprietary system created the images.
            985. How do I measure resistance/capacitance/inductance/impedance?
DMMs
            986. What is a DMM?
            1. A DMM is a standard test and measurement instrument used by electrical engineers and technicians to measure multiple electrical stimuli, including voltage, current and resistance. It combines the features of a voltmeter, ammeter and ohmmeter, and is used to verify the state of a system or circuit for safety purposes.
            987. What can it measure?
            1. A DMM is a standard test and measurement instrument used by electrical engineers and technicians to measure multiple electrical stimuli, including voltage, current and resistance. It combines the features of a voltmeter, ammeter and ohmmeter, and is used to verify the state of a system or circuit for safety purposes.
            988. What is a DMM's sample rate? Does it matter?
            1. A cheap DMM may only sample at 120 or 180 Hertz, as it is designed for a 60 Hz Sine Wave. A better one may use 300 or 360Hz for more accurate measurements.
            989. When to use DMM vs scope?
            1. For general-purpose maintenance or general electronic testing, a digital multimeter is fine, but when testing or troubleshooting machine controls or other complex systems, or doing electronic design work, an oscilloscope is needed.
Scopes
            990. What is an oscilloscope?
            1. An oscilloscope is a type of electronic test instrument that graphically displays varying electrical voltages as a two-dimensional plot of one or more signals as a function of time.
            991. How does an oscilloscope work?
            1. An analog oscilloscope works by directly applying a voltage being measured to an electron beam moving across the oscilloscope screen. The voltage deflects the beam up and down proportionally, tracing the waveform on the screen. This gives an immediate picture of the waveform.
            992. What are triggers on a scope? How do I use them?
            1. Trigger controls allow you to stabilize repetitive waveforms and capture single-shot waveforms. The trigger makes repetitive waveforms appear static on the oscilloscope display by repeatedly displaying the same portion of the input signal.
            993. How do I get current if I'm measuring the voltage across a sense resistor?
            1. The resistor is placed between the supply rail and the load, and the voltage across the resistor is measured. By the basic application of Ohm's Law, I = V/R, so the current is easily determined.
            994. When would I need multiple scope channels?
            1. The main reason to have multiple input channels is to be able to measure several signals simultaneously.
Scope Probes
            995. What is a diff probe? When do I need it?
            1. Differential probes measure the voltage difference between any two input points in contrast to a single- ended probe, which measures input voltage relative to ground. Differential probes are especially popular for measuring high-frequency signals or signals where neither are referenced to ground.
            996. What is an active probe? When do I need it?
            1. Active probes do require external probe power for the active components in the probe, such as transistors and amplifiers, and provide higher bandwidth performance than passive probes. Each category offers many different types of probes, and each probe has an application for which it performs best.
            997. What does the 10x attenuation do on a probe?
            1. Reduce signal amplitude by a factor of ten. Usually by incorporating a 9 megaohm resistor in the probe tip to act as a voltage divider. This added attenuation makes 10x probes good for high-voltage measurements.
            998. What is a current probe?
            1. Current probes are used to evaluate switching elements that are designed to drive circuits in electronic devices such as LEDs and motors. They can measure on/off cycles, ripple waveforms, and switching loss in semiconductor devices that are driven at high speeds.
            999. Probe input impedance - what should it be and why?
            1.  Most modern scopes allow you to choose either 50 Ω or 1 MΩ input resistance. For general-purpose testing, a 1 MΩ input is commonly used.
            1000. When would I want different probe impedance?
            1. For general-purpose testing, a 1 MΩ input is commonly used. A 50 Ω input resistance is used for high-speed signals (think microwaves), propagation delays in logic circuits, and circuit-board impedance testing.
